# Introduction

***

Thunder
 is a Modular architecture with plug and play design where it has a
flexibility to enable or disable any feature just as a plugin.

Key Components available in the THUNDER Framework -

* WPE WebKit - powerful low-resource embedded WebKit engine with Wayland support
* WPE Backend - Abstraction layer for WPE WebKit with support for MESA based gfx or Wayland/EGL gfx
* Thunder - plugin based framework for embedding C/C++ components and bridging the "web" world.
* RDK Services - RDK Services are set of services used to access device specific functionality.RDK Services are available for launching browser and native applications.It is built on WPE Framework (aka Thunder).

Thunder is a small framework built for embedded devices. It consists out of the following main components -

* Framework Core
* Framework Plugins
* Framework UI

<br>

Thunder and RDK Services are key components for micro services to bring into any Box. Thunder offers an event driven interface framework for subsystem availability signaling to the plugins. This framework is utilized to realize concurrent startup scenario using a conditional evaluation only in case a condition changes. This allows for startup without requiring sleeps, or resource consuming polling mechanisms.

For each micro service, we need to implement one plugin as part of RDK Services, and Nano or microservices should configured as part of any of these subsystems.

Designed for Apps:

* Pre-integrated **premium apps**
* Pre-integrated **app store**
* **Voice**enabled
* **Lightning**<sup>tm</sup> App Dev Language

<br>

# WPEFramework goal and Overview

***

### Javascript enabler

Goal is to enable/bridge embedded low level C/C++ technology to the Javascript world and it is done by using Javascript enabler.

## Architecture

<br>

### High-level architecture :

## Thunder Framework Overview

Application framework is built on Hardware abstraction Layer, on top of abstraction layer there is a WPE Framework. WPE framework itself dispatched internally that actually starts micro and nano services. Micro and Nano services are exposed to certain interfaces so at the end the system can locked down and executing.

From Apps, there are external input interface that can send in JSONRPC messages, JSONRPC messages through dispatcher will be routed to proper micro/nano services.

**Modular architecture**

* The system is build up from several layers. The functionality is contained in modules.

**Separation of concern**

* A nano/micro service has its own dedicated task/function and fulfils this. No managers!

**Interface based**

* Interconnection between plugins is based on interfaces.

<br>

# Architectural Focus/Features

***

Click here to expand...

## Architectural Focus

**Agnostic to process boundaries (JSONRPC/COMRPC)**

* For security and stability functionality is realized in contained processes. To communicate to process boundaries we need JSONRPC/COMRPC.

**Integral implementation of security features**

* LXC containerization, including users and groups per processes.

**Small footprint, low resource usage**

* Building it, only requires ZLIB.

**Uniformity**

* All configuration is stored as JSON and read from 1 location, RESTFull API alignment JSON field names always lowercase, path names Pascal case.

## Features

**WebControl**

* WPEFramework can be controlled from a webbrowser client on your PC.

**Scoped Traceability (controlled from Web)**

* Fine granularity, trace what you need, Web Browser UI to control it all..

**Execution architecture (resource constrained)**

* One thread to communicate all.Thread pools.

**Ease of use when building a plugin**

* Object oriented approach for communication (JSON, HTTP, WebSocket, COM/JSON RPC).

**No hard-linked dependencies**

* There is NO dependency between the plugins. Use subsystems !!!!

# RPC Mechanisms Deployed

***

JSONRPC/COMRPC Process transparency

Most important part of framework is to make sure we can run processes & separate process, we can run nano/micro services out of process. So, we need to communicate to nano/micro services throughout API's.

These API's are actually incremented in 2 ways.

1. JSONRPC : Mainly targeted towards Javascript. Javascript talks to JSONRPC , Communication Layer goes into framework then it transit to C and C++ world, then from C and C++ world we can far communicate back to Javascript using JSONRPC .
2. COMRPC : Internally when we want to communicate with different nano/micro services running in different process we can use COMRPC Process.

## COMRPC

COMRPC is a binary RPC migration

* Marshalling code,Proxy/Stubs are generated from the C header file!!

### Interfaces

C header files with a struct definition and pure abstract methods

* It is based on interfaces and its regular struct in header file that is to contract to actually closed down between two plugins or two instances of C&C++.
* This struct and interface is to find how we communicate with other plugin or other nano/micro services.
* If we define structs there is an application that actually creates marshalling code.

### COMRPC

QueryInterface/AddRef/Release

* Under struct, there is a layer coming from WPEframework that is called "COMRPC"
* COMRPC will make sure Pluming URT isn't there so the queryInterface/AddRef/Release will make sure we can do navigation over the interfaces that our lifetime on the interfaces.

### Communication Layers

* Domain Sockets
* TCP Socket

COMRPC migration is part of WPEFramework. If we have COMRPC 'C' migration, the communication layer below are main sockets for TCP Server. It means we could communicate with any interface to other host.

## JSONRPC

JSONRPC is to communicate JSON object messages.

JSON data objects, boiler plated handlers and documentation are generated from a JSON specification file!!

### JSON

Actual exchange data in JSON format : RFC4627

* RFC4627,this is the data message and contract between to separate nano/micro services.
* This is typically used from web world(from spark or from webkit itself).
* The relying of the message and pluming is done using JSONRPC.

### JSONRPC

For deeper and detailed information of JSONRPC ,Please refer [https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)

### Communication Layers

* RESTFUL (Web World)
* WebSocket (Web World)

# Execution Architecture

<br>

* If a command comes in on settop box ,it will actually be turn into message for eg in above figure ,the Webkit browser will send this message through pipeline to framework. Three pipelines coming out of the settop box, different pipelines for different kind of messages.
* Received message will be deserialized that is getting back to original message and do get cpu usage. After which, we will look at the message where it has to sent to, that message will be packed with where it will send to and it is forward on to threadpool.
* The threadpool are actually multiple threads maintained by multiple persons. Person pickups the job and secure it ,As in diagram the person is evaluating CPU Usage using machine, CPU Usage value is noted down on the message(eg: CPU usage is 50% in above figure) and send back to from where we initially got the message.
* Here messages are handled by thread switch. One is communication thread and the other is thread that handled our request. This way the amount of threads used in the system will not increase when multiple connections are created, the more connections you create it will not lead to multiple threadings .

# Resources opened up through JSONRPC

This gives us information regarding once system is ready ,what kind of micro/nano services are all available.<br>
Difference between micro and nano is that micro service actually requires graphics -graphical resources or player resources.

RDK
 is a community-based project that allows developers, vendors and cable
operators to use a defined stack of software on one layer in order to
provisionÂ set-top boxes and gateways. Unique features of RDK such
as **commitment to open source,** **speed** and **flexibility** of RDK-based devices makes it stand out from the conventional settop software stacks.

# Code Contribution Workflow

* Deployment ready [Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+Gerrit#CodeSubmissionProcessRDKCentralGerrit-RDKComponents-ProductBranch) has been created for RDK components that the community will push changes to review & It is with higher standards of test qualification
* Monthly Sprint Branch (rdk-dev-yymm) is a new CMF integration branch, created monthly and baseline off [Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+Gerrit#CodeSubmissionProcessRDKCentralGerrit-RDKComponents-ProductBranch) Branch. This branch will be hosted per repository in conjunction with Product branch with the goal of incorporating community changes at the earliest juncture.
* Community changes, once approved, will be cherry-picked to Monthly Sprint branch (rdk-dev-yymm) and will thus be available prior to the completion of down-streaming/ round-trip process.
* Approved contributions will be down-streamed to **Regression Branch** for pre-deployment validation using their test process
  - Defects will be planned in monthly sprints
  - Features will be presented for Architecture Review to be scheduled to an upcoming sprint. Sprint timelines to be published to contributor.
  - Contributions pending validation will be available in monthly development iteration branches
* Down streamed Community changes, successfully merged to Regression branch, after pre-deployment test validation, the code changes will be cherry-picked to [Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+Gerrit#CodeSubmissionProcessRDKCentralGerrit-RDKComponents-ProductBranch).

# Code Contribution Workflow Diagram

1. User will do code contribution to rdk-next branch. This will undergo:
  1. Code reviews
  2. Build verification
  3. License compliance scan
  4. Test validation
2. Once successful, the change will get cherry-picked to **Monthly Sprint Branch** (rdk-dev-yymm)
3. This code is then down-streamed to **Regression Branch** where pre-deployment test validation are done
4. Once Comcast accepts, the change-set is cherry picked to **[Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+Gerrit#CodeSubmissionProcessRDKCentralGerrit-RDKComponents-ProductBranch)**.
5. Thus the change gets merged to **[Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+Gerrit#CodeSubmissionProcessRDKCentralGerrit-RDKComponents-ProductBranch)**

<br>

<br>

Component owners/reviewers/approvers, defined as specific groups in Gerrit, will be added to the review by default. You may request additional feedback by specifically adding reviewers via the Gerrit web GUI.

# Product Branch

Product branch is a deployment ready branch is created for RDK components that the community will push changes to review.

Refer to [Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+Gerrit#CodeSubmissionProcessRDKCentralGerrit-RDKComponents-ProductBranch) for the Components hosted in CMF Gerrit ([https://code.rdkcentral.com](https://code.rdkcentral.com/))

Refer to [RDK Central GitHub Components & its Branches](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Submission+Process+-+RDK+Central+GitHub) hosted in [https://github.com/rdkcentral/](https://github.com/rdkcentral/)

# Monthly Sprint Branch

Monthly Sprint Branch (rdk-dev-yymm) is a new CMF integration branch, created monthly and baseline off [Product Branch](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Code+Contribution+Process#CodeContributionProcess-ProductBranch). This branch will be hosted per repository in conjunction with Product branch with the goal of incorporating community changes at the earliest juncture.

Once community changes is approved, will be cherry-picked to Monthly Sprint branch (rdk-dev-yymm) and will thus be available prior to the completion of down-streaming to Regression Branch / round-trip process.

# Regression Branch

Regression branch is the branch used for validation of the contributions. Approved contributions will be down-streamed to **Regression Branch** for pre-deployment validation using their test process.

* Defects will be planned in monthly sprints
* Features will be presented for Architecture Review to be scheduled to an upcoming sprint. Sprint timelines to be published to contributor.
* Contributions pending validation will be available in monthly development iteration branches

Down streamed Community changes, successfully merged to Regression branch, after pre-deployment test validation, the code changes will be cherry-picked to Product Branch.

All streaming will be done by the Media Streamer in the
Gateway (Hybrid) device. The RMF source element in the Client box will
receive the data and do the processing.

# **Live Streaming to Client Device**

Here all the data is streamed from the media streamer through Home networking sink. HNSrc in the Client will receive the data from HNSink and playback using the RMF pipeline.

* Here SPTS (Single Program Transport Stream) data is streamed from the media streamer through Home networking sink. HN Src in the Client device will receive the data from HN sink and playback using the RMF pipe line.
* After receiving the request URI, the media server creates an RMFQAM source element and HN Sink element.
* RMFQAM source tunes to a particular program, starts pumping clear SPTS stream.
* Media Server connects the QAM Source to the HN Sink. HN Source receives the media at the client side for play out.
* In the case of encrypted media play out, the stream data is decrypted using the POD manager which is invoked by the QAM source. QAM Source sends the clear SPTS to the HN Sink.
* Media server registers to get events from QAM Source. Through the event mechanism QAM Source will send user authorization related information to the Media Server.
* The Media Server sends this information to client device.
* DTCP encryption and decryption are used for protecting contents over network.

# **Live Streaming to Client Device : Use Case**

* The right side of the figure is considered for client boxes.
* The left side of the figure is considered for gateway box.
* In case of live streamthe HTTPReqHandler will receive a request from client box and the MediaStreamer will set a pipeline between QAM Source and HN Sink.
* QAM Srcelement receives the data from the tuner and sends to the HN Sink.
* In the client side another pipeline has created between HNSrcand MediaPlayerSink.
* HNSrc receives the incoming data from HNSinkand feeds to the MediaPlayerSinkfor live playback.
* DTCP encryption and decryption are used for protecting contents over network.

# Overview of Yocto

The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates, tools and methods to help create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products. It is an open source project initiated by the Linux Foundation in 2010. The Yocto Project uses the OpenEmbedded build system to construct complete Linux images.

The core components of the Yocto Project are:

* **BitBake**, the build engine is a task scheduler, like make. It interprets configuration files and recipes (also called metadata) to perform a set of tasks, to download, configure and build specified packages and filesystem images.
* **OpenEmbedded-Core**, a set of base layers. It is a set of recipes, layers and classes which are shared between all OpenEmbedded based systems. Recipes have a specific syntax and describe how to fetch, configure, compile and package applications and images. Layers are sets of recipes, matching a common purpose. Multiple layers are used within a same distribution, depending on the requirements.

# Yocto Architecture

## BitBake

BitBake is the task executor and scheduler used by the OpenEmbedded build system to build images. BitBake is a generic task execution engine that allows shell and Python tasks to be run efficiently and in parallel while working within complex inter-task dependency constraints. BitBake stores the output of each task in a directory, the shared state cache. Its location is controlled by the SSTATE_DIR variable. This cache is use to speed up compilation.
Usage:Â  **bitbake [options] [recipename/target ...]**

Bitbake executes all the layers starting with a prefix 'meta'.

The build/ directory

* **conf/** : Configuration files - image specific and layer configuration.
* **downloads/** : This folder stores the downloaded upstream tarballs of the packages used in the builds, facilitating fast rebuilds. If the content of this folder is deleted, the builds will go and refetch the source tars again.
* **sstate-cache/** : Shared state cache, it is the local prebuilt store used by all builds. It will be populated when you do the builds. It is important to keep this directory safe for sstate reuse.
* **tmp/** : Holds all the build.
* **tmp/buildstats/** : Build statistics for all packages built (CPU usage, elapsed time, host, timestamps).
* **tmp/deploy/** : Final output of the build.
* **tmp/deploy/images/** : Contains the complete images built by the OpenEmbedded build system. These images are used to flash the target.
* **tmp/work/** : Set of specific work directories, split by architecture. They are used to unpack, configure and build the packages. Contains the patched sources, generated objects and logs.
* **tmp/sysroots/** : Shared libraries and headers used to compile packages for the target but also for the host.

build-<machine>
 (e.g. build-oem-platform) - This is the object/build directory, all
objects and intermediate files for all components are stored in this
folder. if you want to do a clean build you can delete this folder, then
 run ./meta-cmf/setup-environment and rebuild. The build will be very
fast since it will reuse the sstate (prebuilts) during this build,
assuming the sstate-cache directory was populated with previous builds
already.

## Meta-layers

Meta-layer contains configuration, recipes, classes, patches.

* Configuration (*.conf) files: global definition of variables
* Classes (*.bbclass): encapsulation and inheritance of build logic, packaging etc.
* Recipes (*.bb, *.bbappend): logical units of software/Images to build

Bitbake parses the build classes, config files, and recipes. For every task, a shell script on-the-fly is created and executed.

## Recipe

Recipes are essentially a set of instructions for building packages. A recipe describes where you get source code and which patches to apply. Recipes describe dependencies for libraries or for other recipes, and they also contain configuration and compilation options. Recipes contain the logical unit of execution, the software to build, the images to build, and use the .bb file extension.

The recipes are parsed by the BitBake build engine. The format of a recipe file name is <package-name>_<version>.bb

A recipe contains configuration variables: name, license, dependencies, path to retrieve the source code etc. It also contains functions that can be run (fetch, configure, compile. . .), called tasks.

Recipe provides:

* Descriptive information about the package.
* Existing dependencies (both build and runtime dependencies)
* DEPENDS & RDEPENDS variables holds the build & runtime dependencies e.g.
* Where the source code resides and how to fetch it: SRC_URI variable holds the URL path to fetch
* The version of the recipe
* Whether the source code requires any patches, where to find them, and how to apply them
* How to configure and compile the source code
* Where on the target machine to install the package or packages created

## Append Files

Files that append build information to a recipe file. Append files are known as BitBake append files and .bbappend files. The OpenEmbedded build system expects every append file to have a corresponding recipe (.bb) file. Furthermore, the append file and corresponding recipe file must use the same root filename. The filenames can differ only in the file type suffix used (e.g. [formfactor_0.0.bb](http://formfactor_0.0.bb/) and formfactor_0.0.bbappend).

Information in append files overrides the information in the similarly-named recipe file.

## Patches

Patches can be applied to recipe files. Patch files should be having extension *.patch. Place the patch file in subdirectory of recipe named (component) folder. The subdirectory should be preferably named as that of component or as 'files'. Add the below line to the recipe file

SRC_URI += [file://filename.patch](file:///)

<br>

# External SRC

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system uses the Build Directory when building source code. The build process involves fetching the source files, unpacking them, and then patching them if necessary before the build takes place.

Yocto place individual components at discrete locations for the build purpose. For example; consider emulator build

../../< Project Folder> /build-qemux86mc/tmp/work/i586-rdk-linux/iarmbus

../../<Project Folder> /build-qemux86mc/tmp/work/qemux86mc-rdk-linux/devicesettings

It will be difficult for a developer to do a code walk through since the entire source code is spread across multiple directories. You might want to build software from source files that are external to and thus outside of the OpenEmbedded build system.For example

../../<Project Folder> /generic

You want the recipe's SRC_URI variable to point to the external directory and use it as is, not copy it. Yocto provides a solution to this by its external SRC support. By this all the components will be pulled to a single place. Say, you are component owner and only focused to modify source code of that component and build it alone. Modify the files under ../../<Project Folder> /generic/iarmbus (as an example; you can modify any component like this)

bitbake iarmbus (as an example; you can build any component like this)

To build from software that comes from an external source, all you need to do is inherit the externalsrc class and then set the EXTERNALSRC variable to point to your external source code.

The statements to put in your local.conf file are illustrated below:
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `INHERIT += ` `"externalsrc"` `EXTERNALSRC_pn-myrecipe = ` `"path-to-your-source-tree"` |

<br>

By default, externalsrc.bbclass builds the source code in a directory separate from the external source directory as specified by EXTERNALSRC. If you need to have the source built in the same directory in which it resides, or some other nominated directory, you can set EXTERNALSRC_BUILD to point to that directory:
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `EXTERNALSRC_BUILD_pn-myrecipe = ` `"path-to-your-source-tree"` |

To know the components building from external SRC, see the content of the file ../../< Project Folder> /build-qemux86mc/conf/auto.conf (In case of emulator)

* Easy migration to different hardware platform
* Reduces the build time
* Supports major embedded architectures
* Provides a layered mechanism
* Easy to extend the configuration
* Reduce the cost of development
* RDK wanted to have a common infrastructure which supports multiple architectures
* Standard Distribution and tools

This section is intended to help SoC/ OEM vendors to integrate RDK's Yocto framework to their platform.

A basic description about SoC and OEM layers can be found here: [Yocto layers](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Yocto+Integration+in+RDK#YoctoIntegrationinRDK-yoctolayers)

# **SoC layer design guidelines**

* There shall be separate configuration file (.inc) for each variant of chip-set which will be used by the OEM layer to build a specific device.
* There shall be an option to build an image for reference platforms
* There shall be only one layer for a particular SoC which can support multiple chip variants and the same layer can be integrated with different OEM layers
* All the binaries and libraries shall be installed in /usr/bin and /usr/lib of RFS ; It shall not be installed in any other directory. Remember /bin /sbin /lib are for system binaries and libraries which are common for all platforms.The /usr/local is used for overriding the existing one with recompiled binary/library which is not applicable in Set Top Box scenario.

# **OEM layer design guidelines**

* There shall be separate device (machine) configuration file (.conf) for each device for the particular chip family for which the OEM layer is intended for<br>
For Eg : A layer "meta-rdk-oem-OEM-X-SOC-Y" means this layer shall be able to build any devices manufactured by OEM "X" with all variants of SoC "Y" like Y-1,Y-2 etc
* It is recommended to use small case alphanumerical characters to denote a machine configuration file. For example ; qemux86.conf. Avoid special characters, "_" etc. Remember an "_" denotes overriding in Yocto scenario and therefore using it for configuration file name can cause issues.
* If one OEM use two different SoCs for different devices, there shall be two separate layers such as "meta-rdk-oem-OEM-X-SOC-Y" , "meta-rdk-oem-OEM-X-SOC-Z" etc
* The device (machine) configuration file shall include corresponding include (.inc) file to get machine configuration details.

# **Guideline to create OEM specific images**

All the work needs be done only in the meta-rdk-oem layer

Write a recipe <oem>-[image-tools-native.bb](http://image-tools-native.bb/) under recipes-tools to copy all the tools, binaries and scripts needed to create custom oem image to the staging binary directory

* This recipe should fetch all the sources from the GIT repo
* Example name space for the GIT repo where you should place all the tools like permission files, authentication keys etc - **"rdk/devices/<OEM>/<OEM_device>/tools"**
* Example namespace for the GIT repo to keep all the binaries (crcsum etc) - **"rdk/devices/<OEM>/<OEM_device>/bin"**
* This recipe will have only one task â do_install, which copies all the necessary files to create oem images to staging binary directory
* **"**inherit native" this class would short-circuit all the target build and strip tasks.

# **Adding a new SoC/OEM to RDK**

Adding a new machine to the Yocto Project is a straightforward process which involves following steps:

* Create a new layer which will hold all the recipes and machine configurations for the new SoC/OEM.
* Adding the Machine Configuration File for the new SoC/OEM.
* Adding a Kernel for the Machine.
* Adding Recipe for SoC/OEM
* Creating packages for building images

## **Creating the new SoC /OEM Layer**

Use the yocto-layer create sub-command to create a new general layer.

* yocto-layer create mylayer

There shall be separate device (machine) configuration file (.conf) for each device for the particular chip family for which the layer is intended for

* For Eg : A layer "meta-rdk-oem-OEM-X-SOC-Y" means this layer shall be able to build any devices manufactured by OEM "X" with all variants of SoC "Y" like Y-1,Y-2 etc

The device (machine) configuration file shall include corresponding include (.inc) file to get machine configuration details.

## **Adding the Machine Configuration File**

To add a machine configuration, you need to add a .conf file with details of the device being added to the conf/machine/ file.<br>
The most important variables to set in this file are as follows:

* TARGET_ARCH (e.g. "arm")
* PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel
* MACHINE_FEATURES (e.g. "apm screen wifi")

You might also need these variables:

* KERNEL_IMAGETYPE (e.g. "zImage")
* IMAGE_FSTYPES (e.g. "tar.gz jffs2")

The default configuration are defined in meta-rdk/conf/distro/rdk.conf and it should be overwritten by the machine specific conf file.<br>
For example, meta-rdk-oem-<>/meta-<>/conf/machine/include/<>.inc

* PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/iarmmgrs-hal = "iarmmgrs-hal-broadcom"
* PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/closedcaption-hal = "closedcaption-hal-broadcom"

## **Adding a Kernel for the Machine**

The OpenEmbedded build system needs to be able to build a kernel for the machine. We need to either create a new kernel recipe for this machine, or extend an existing recipe. There are several kernel examples in the Source Directory at meta/recipes-kernel/linux that can be used as references. <br>
If you are creating a new recipe, following steps need to be done:

* setting up a SRC_URI.
* Specify any necessary patches
* create a configure task that configures the unpacked kernel with a defconfig.

If you are extending an existing kernel, it is usually a matter of adding a suitable defconfig file. The file needs to be added into a location similar to defconfig files used for other machines in a given kernel.<br>
A possible way to do this is by listing the file in the SRC_URI and adding the machine to the expression in COMPATIBLE_MACHINE:

* COMPATIBLE_MACHINE = '(qemux86|qemumips)'

## **Adding recipes for SoC /OEM**

The following kind of recipes can be added to SoC/OEM layer. The recipes shall be grouped as described in slide "BSP Reference Layer"

* recipes (.bb) to build Kernel
* recipes(.bb) to build SDK
* Kernel patches (SoC/OEM specific - if any)
* SDK patches (SoC/OEM specific - if any)
* Any SoC/OEM specific scripts or files which need to be installed in RFS

## **Creating packages for building images**

* Create a custom package-group for the SoC/OEM which shall list all the recipes that are required for the image.
* Create a custom image for generating RFS for required SoC/OEM.

# **Bitbake work-flow**

* All the components are built using individual recipes. There shall be a main image recipe (example , rdk-generic-image) which includes all other required recipe and create the final RFS
* Package groups recipe is one support a image recipe to select the set of packages
* The recipes will be called in sequence<br>
(1) opensource components<br>
(2) Kernel<br>
(3) SDK<br>
(4) RDK<br>
(5) MSO<br>
(6) Packaging and create final image.
* The final linux and RFS image will be created under build_folder/tmp/deploy/images

This
 guide is intended to help developers understand the Yocto framework in
RDK so they can extend the existing functionality.Â

Configuration

Configuration (*.conf) comprises of global definition of variables. There are two types of configurations:

* User configuration
* Machine configuration(BSP)

## User Configuration

<br>

## Machine/BSP Configuration

BSPs are layers that add machine settings and recipes. It contains extensions and customizations to base system. They are added to the BBLAYERS variable in build/conf/bblayers.conf <br>
Machine settings are specified in a layer's conf/machine/xxx.conffile(s) <br>
For Example:

../meta-rdk-bsp-emulator/conf/machine/qemux86hyb.conf

For Device:

../meta-rdk-oem-<OEM Name>-<SoCName>/conf/machine/<configuration_file_name>.conf

# RDK Recipes

Recipes are the most basic metadata files which are denoted by the file extension*.bb. Recipes can build one or more packages from source code.

They provide:

* Descriptive information about the package
* Existing dependencies (both build and runtime dependencies)
* DEPENDS & RDEPENDS variables holds the build & runtime dependencies e.g.
* DEPENDS = "closedcaption-hal-headers"
* RDEPENDS = "libcrypto"

* Where the source code resides and how to fetch it,
* SRC_URI variable holds the URL path to fetch
* SRC_URI = "${RDK_GENERIC_ROOT_GIT}/devicesettings/generic;protocol=${RDK_GIT_PROTOCOL};branch=${RDK_GIT_BRANCH}"
* The version of the recipe
* SRCREV= "${AUTOREV}" /
* SRCREV= "6c492f7452a6b4b240f1b572dbda2f2bcc4faf2d"
* Whether the source code requires any patches, where to find them, and how to apply them
* How to configure and compile the source code
* Where on the target machine to install the package or packages created

## Recipe Append files

Append files are identified by the extension *.bbappend. They are used to extend or override information in an existing recipe file. BitBake expects every append file to have a corresponding recipe (*.bb) file. A missing .bb file will be shown as an warning by the BitBake parser. The append file and corresponding recipe file must use the same root filename.<br>
Example: [devicesettings_git.bb](http://devicesettings_git.bb/) & devicesettings_git.bbappend

# Bitbake variables/meta data

These are set automatically by bitbake.

* TOPDIR â The build directory
* LAYERDIR â Current layer directory
* FILE â Path and filename of file being processed

## Build time meta-data

* PN â Pakage name ("myrecipe")
* PV â Package version (1.0)
* PR â Package Release (r0)
* P = "${PN}-${PV}"
* PF = "${PN}-${PV}-${PR}"
* FILE_DIRNAME â Directory for FILE
* FILESPATH = "${FILE_DIRNAME}/${PF}:\
* TOPDIR â The build directory
* TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp"
* WORKDIR = ${TMPDIR}/work/${PF}"
* S = "${WORKDIR}/${P}" (Source dir)
* B = "${S}" (Build dir)
* D = "${WORKDIR}/${image}" (Destination dir)
* DEPLOY_DIR = "${TMPDIR}/deploy"
* DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE = "${DEPLOY_DIR}/images"

## Dependency meta-data

Build time package variables

* DEPENDS â Build time package dependencies
* PROVIDES = "${P} ${PF} ${PN}"

Runtime package variables

* RDEPENDS â Runtime package dependencies
* RRECOMMENDS â Runtime recommended packages
* RSUGGESTS â Runtime suggested packages
* RPROVIDES â Runtime provides
* RCONFLICTS â Runtime package conflicts
* RREPLACES â Runtime package replaces

## Common meta-data

Variables you commonly set

* SUMMARY â Short description of package/recipe
* HOMEPAGE â Upstream web page
* LICENSE â Licenses of included source code
* LIC_FILES_CHKSUM â Checksums of license files at time of packaging (checked for change by build)
* SRC_URI â URI of source code, patches and extra files to be used to build packages. Uses different fetchers based on the URI.
* FILES â Files to be included in binary packages

# Patching

Patches can be applied to recipe files. Patch files extension *.patch. Place the patch file in subdirectory of recipe named (component) folder. The subdirectory should be preferably named as that of component or as 'files'. Add the below line to the recipe file<br>
SRC_URI += "[file://temp.patch](file:///)"

More information on patches can be found [here](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-V+Modify+and+Build+Components)

# Prebuilts with Yocto

## **RDK License**

SoC vendors are advised to get into an agreement with RDK Management LLC to obtain the free license so as to use the complete RDK Code base in their platform. More details about license is available at [https://rdkcentral.com/licenses/](https://rdkcentral.com/licenses/). Please email [info@rdkcentral.com](mailto:info@rdkcentral.com)if you have additional questions about licenses or membership

<br>

# **Bringing up RDK by SoC - Approach**

<br>

<br>

This section will detail the recommended step by step procedure of adopting RDK by a SoC

<br>

## **Product Specifications**

***

The first step to get a fully functional product is to define the product features and see if they meet the standard requirements. See [here](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-V+Features) to know what are all the features available in RDK-V and can implement based on your requirement. SoC can use this as a guide while engineering the RDK SoC platform.

## **RDKM On-boarding**

***

RDKM provides a collaboration zone facility for SoCs to facilitate easier engineering of RDK based devices. The collaboration zone will help SoCs to work with OEMs, RDKM and any 3<sup>rd</sup> party along with a common space to develop & integrate, manage and verify the device. The zone includes facilities for code management, a confluence based RDK Wiki for knowledge management & sharing, a JIRA for tracking activity progress, issues as well as to manage the activities, a test setup to validate devices. The access restrictions implemented will help the collaboration zone to be accessible only for the authorized personnel thereby guarding any sensitive information related to SoC/OEM/Third party.

## **Product Engineering**

***

Once the product features are decided, the device engineering can be started. SoC needs to decide on the hardware layout that incorporates components to the target board. Device will be categorized as Low Profile and High Profile device based on the hardware capabilities. In a low profile device 4k support might be optional but it is expected to have 4k support in high profile device.

### Sample Reference Flash Layout (Optional) :

## **SoC Platform Firmware**

***

<br>

SoC can make use of the below details available to start developing a Yocto build to engineer the device firmware builds based on RDK Yocto build setup.

### Yocto Manifests

Yocto based RDK builds are flexible enough to easily accommodate SoC / OEM / MSO / third party changes. The starting point for the Yocto builds are a manifest file. The manifest file is an xml file that contains details of the different open embedded Yocto build layers, meta layers , rdk as well as open source components that needs to be fetched during initial stages ( than during bitbake time ) as well as the URL locations from where the data can be pulled. A set of sample manifests that can be used as a template for developing SoC specific manifests are given below

<br>

This is the starting point of the build and is specific to a device/board . If the SoC has only one target device /board, still it is recommended to maintain a different manifest for SoC for keeping it future-proof. Usually it contains references to other manifest files which will be having specific set of repos  |

SoC/OEM meta-layer creation

To match the layered structure of Yocto builds, a SoC specific layer is used to include SoC changes and additions. Use the yocto-layer create sub-command to create a new general layer.
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `$ yocto-layer create mylayer` |

There shall be separate device (machine) configuration file (.conf) for each device for the particular chip family for which the layer is intended for. The general naming terminology for SoC layer is meta-rdk-SoC-<SoC name>

The device (machine) configuration file shall include corresponding include (.inc) file to get machine configuration details.

<br>

Click here for more details on SoC/OEM meta-layer creation

#### **Adding the Machine Configuration File for the new SoC**

Each meta-* layer should have a conf folder containing the machine configuration we can select during 'source setup-environment' . O ptionally it can also have a class/classes folder for keeping information that is useful to share between metadata files.

To add a machine configuration, you need to add a .conf file with details of the device being added to the conf/machine/ file. In the machine conf file the basic machine configuration should be defined.

SoC can have several meta-rdk-<chip-set> layers containing chip specific implementation.

Generally conf file name will be SoC name. If both OEM and SoC are present then machine configuration should be coming from master i.e. OEM . It means whatever image that gets created comes from meta-rdk-oem

<br>

The most important variables to set in this file are as follows :

* Include .inc's ,basically these inc's are from SoC layer and these .inc's are platform dependent.
* Fill the MACHINEOVERRIDES (Eg: If it is media client, give client name)

[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `MACHINEOVERRIDES=` `" "` |

* For particular SoC build , if they are overwriting any kernel version or gcc compiler version or whatever preferred should be defined in machine conf file.

For SoC, The most important variables to set in this conf file are as follows :
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `TARGET_ARCH (e.g. ` `"arm"` `)` `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual` `/kernel` `(Eg:` `"linux-<chip set name>"` `)` `MACHINE_FEATURES (e.g. ` `"apm screen wifi"` `)` `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE (e.g. ` `"uImage"` `) ` `IMAGE_FSTYPES (e.g. ` `"tar.gz ext4"` `)` |

<br>

#### **Basic configuration of building kernel**

Standard meta-rdk/recipe-core/images will have different kinds of images which one can use and build.

This recipe-core/images will have bbappend or main image name. If meta-rdk is used( i.e. meta-rdk image ) then bbappend of that image client is required

For example,

_<image name>.bbappend_

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) Define "bbappend of images" and "conf file" as required.

<br>

#### **SoC meta-layer recipes**

Generally SoC meta-layer (Eg: meta-<SoC name>) will have following recipes
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `SoC meta layer recipes-` `=========================================` `recipes-bsp` `recipes-core` `recipes-kernel` `recipes-connectivity` `recipes-graphics` `recipes-support etc` `The structure of meta-<SoC name>` `/recipes-support/` `<SoC-img-packer>/&#xA0;is as follows -` `=========================================` `$` `ls` `<SoC-img-packer-native>.bb&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;files` |

## **TDK and RDK Certification Suite Package**

***

RDKM offers an in-house Test & certification suite that facilitates SoCs to get their IP Set-top product certified as RDK Compliant device.

Certification program includes testing which validates the RDK stack on the device with defined test suite called as RDK Certification Test Suite. It is mandatory to go through this program in order to brand user's platform as RDK compliant product.

Certification suite is available at [RDK IP Set-top Product Certification](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Certification)(only for RDK licensee) and for TDK test app please refer [TDK-V Documentation (only for RDK licensee)](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK-V+Documentation).

## **SDK Releases**

***

Once the RDK bring-up in SoC is completed, the vendor needs to plan on the delivery of the software to OEM vendors. This usually happens in 2 ways:

### HAL + SDK binary

In this approach will make use of the RDK Artifactory server. Artifactory server is a Repository Manager that functions as a single access point organizing all the binary resources including proprietary libraries, remote artifacts and other 3rd party resources. It is a secure and restricted server, only collaboration members will have access to this server. SoC secure information like secure components such as PlayReady, widevine and Dolby libraries etc. can be hosted in Artifactory server.

SoC vendor can define a HAL layer, share the source of HAL & yocto meta layer that can be stored in RDK CMF Git repository (which will be shared only to authorized OEM vendors who will work in collaboration with the SoC vendor), share the SDK binary that can be stored in RDK Artifactory (which will be shared only to authorized OEM vendors who will work in collaboration with the SoC vendor) and then publish necessary documentation on how to build the SoC SDK. SoC vendor can use the git/ Artifactory for periodic updated (for releases) or for bug fixes. All the source code, binary and documentation will be strictly access restricted and access will be allowed only for authorized personnel by SoC vendor.

Artifactory server can be accessed by adding the Artifactory details and login credentials in the .netrc file, just like it is done for normal git repositories. A sample is given below:

machine your.artifactory.host<br>
login YOUR_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME<br>
password YOUR_PASSWORD_OR_KEY_OR_TOKEN

### Complete source code

In this approach, SoC vendor can define a HAL layer, share the source of HAL , yocto meta layer and SDK source code that can be stored in RDK CMF Git repository( which will be shared only to authorized OEM vendors who will work in collaboration with the SoC vendor ) and then publish necessary documentation on how to build the SoC SDK. SoC vendor can use the git for periodic updated ( for releases ) or for bug fixes. All the source code and documentation will be strictly access restricted and access will be allowed only for authorized personnel by SoC vendor.

<br>

For both approaches, the RDKM collaboration zone will be used with strict access restrictions.

<br>

## **Collaboration with OEMs**

***

After a successful bring up of RDK on SoC platform, the next step will be to allow OEMs to work with SoCs to get a device based on the SoC platform. RDKM offers collaboration space for SoCs which would help SoCs to collaborate with OEM and RDK teams (as well as any 3rd party) in their journey to engineer a successful RDK product. RDKM collaboration zone includes features like (but not limited to) CMF facility to maintain build manifests as well as SoC/OEM specific code, SoC SDK artifact storage facility, JIRA & RDK Wiki spaces, integration with Test & Certification suites, monthly & release tagging etc.

Please refer [RDKM On-boarding](#rdkvideodocumentation-rdkmon-boarding) for more details on facilities available for SoCs and OEMs as part of collaboration zone . In short, it will include:

* Access restricted Git repositories and Artifactory servers
* Access restricted Confluence and JIRA spaces for Management and Documentation
* Access to RDKM support as well as extended documentation
* Access to test & certification support

<br>

# **RDK porting guide to SoC vendors**

<br>

<br>

The aim of this SoC porting guide is to guide SoC Vendors on how to port RDK to their platforms.

<br>

<br>

### **Step 1 : Get a board with Linux and drivers**

RDK is based on Yocto Linux. Prior to porting RDK on a SoC , the precondition is to have the SoC platform running on Linux. The Linux version can be a SoC specific one with kernal hardening and other OS optimizations specific to SoC, as RDK could easily run on top of vendor specific Linux. SoC should also provide drivers for the other peripherals in SoC platform, like WiFi, so that the unit can work independently and completely from a SoC point of view.

### **Step 2Â : Move the build to Yocto, compare it to supported Yocto version of RDK**

Once SoC vendor is ready with an own port of Linux + drivers for the SoC platform, it is time to migrate the platform to Yocto based builds. If the SoC is already having a Yocto based Linux, this step can be skipped. The current Yocto versions supported are Yocto 3.1- Dunfell ( preferred ) as well as Yocto 2.2- Morty ( soon to be deprecated )

Yocto 3.1 Upgradation support the following:

* Version upgrades for bitbake, GStreamer and other OE components
* Linux kernel 5.4 or above
* Extensible SDK

Each component in RDK is a standalone repository with its own individual build tools producing a library or set of binaries. When OE layers are upgraded to the newer versions, necessary changes need to be made in the RDK Yocto meta layers which use these components, to avoid build failures.

### **Step 3 : Compare and verify the compiler flags used in RDK and in platform to avoid issues**

This is an important step while porting RDK to a new SoC platform. RDK Linux is built with considering particular build flags/features in target platform( For example, RDK considers hardware floating point in platform where as some platforms are on software based floating point ). SoC vendor need to analyze such flags in RDK and then make a comparison with the existing SoC platform Linux to ensure compatibility or to understand the required modifications in RDK code so as to house the compatibility changes

Specific DISTRO_FEATURES can be added to support build time flag for specific platforms. For example : DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " referencepltfm "

### **Step 4 : Compare the open source versions used in platform as different versions will cause problems**

Depending on the Yocto version, the RDK build will be working with some particular version of Open source components. This might either be a dependency with the Yocto version compatibility as such or with RDK ( functionality or license issues ). If the SoC Linux has some version dependency on particular open source software and, if it conflicts with the version in RDK, vendor needs to make required changes to make the open source version to match the RDK requirements as best as possible, by adding required patches in SoC platform

Check below layers for all opensourced version packages recipes used in RDK. If multiple recipes with different versions are available, then check for the value of **PREFFERED_VERSION_<recipe name>** set.

Meta layers : - meta-openembedded, openembedded-core, meta-rdk-ext, meta-rdk, meta-cmf

### **Step 5 : Move the RDK recipes to platform Yocto build**

For platform specific recipes, keep them in SoC meta layer. While it is a good practice to start afresh with a new manifest for the target platform, manifest file for a similar featured platform can be used as a starting point too. Check all device specific repos in the reference manifest, and ensure corresponding device repos are created for this new device as needed, and update the manifest with these updated repos

* Create artifactory repo for the project with appropriate permissions for vendors. This is used for hosting any binaries required for the project
* Check-in SoC components - tool chain, SDK, kernel, drivers, etc.. to corresponding SoC gerrit repos/ artifactory as applicable
* Populate meta SoC layer with initial set of changes needed to build kernel, SoC components, etc..
* If there is any SoC reference board exists, create corresponding machine configuration in SoC layer, and create a image target to be able to build final image for the reference board. This layer should be separated out with in meta SoC layer from other common SoC, common chip sub layers which will be usually used by meta oem layer as well.
* Populate meta oem layer with machine configuration and other bare minimum changes required to generate a target image for OEM board.
* machine configuration can be updated with "NEEDED_BSPLAYERS" field to include required SoC, OEM layers in the build
* Any unwanted recipes during early stage of bring up can be masked using BBMASK, if needed.

### **Step 6 : Get a successful build**

Add platform specific main recipe to create image.

<br>

## **HAL implementation by SoC**

***

#### **Device Settings**

Device settings component is having a HAL interface to control device specific peripherals such as video port, audio port and display and front panel.

More details on HAL interface can be found here: [Device Settings HAL Types & Public API](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/doxygen/rdkv-opensourced/d3/d55/group___d_s_s_e_t_t_i_n_g_s___h_a_l.html) DTCP HAL Interfaces.

[Bringing up RDK by OEM- Approach](#rdkvideodocumentation-bringinguprdkbyoem-approach)

[Procedure for OEM porting of RDK](#rdkvideodocumentation-procedureforoemportingofrdk)

# **Before You Begin**

## **RDK License**

***

OEMs are advised to get into an agreement with RDK Management LLC to obtain the free license so as to use the complete RDK Code base in their platform. More details about license is available at [https://rdkcentral.com/licenses/](https://rdkcentral.com/licenses/) . Please email [info@rdkcentral.com](mailto:info@rdkcentral.com) if you have additional questions about licenses or membership

# **Bringing up RDK by OEM- Approach**

<br>

This section will detail the recommended step by step procedure of adopting RDK by OEM.

## **Product Specifications**

***

The first step to get a fully functional product is to define the product features and see if they meet the standard requirements. See [here](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-V+Features) to know what are all the features available in RDK-V and can implement based on your requirement. OEM can cross check the expected features/specifications with the capabilities of the SoC platform being used and can finalize the features supported by the product.

## **RDKM On-boarding**

***

RDKM provides a collaboration zone facility for OEMs to facilitate easier engineering of RDK based devices. The collaboration zone will help OEMs to work with SoCs, RDKM and any 3<sup>rd</sup> party along with a common space to develop & integrate, manage and verify the device. The zone includes facilities for Code management, a confluence based RDK Wiki for knowledge management & sharing, a JIRA for tracking activity progress, issues as well as to manage the activities, a test setup to validate devices. The access restrictions implemented will help the collaboration zone to be accessible only for the authorized personnel thereby guarding any sensitive information related to SoC/OEM/Third party.

## **Device Firmware**

***

OEM can make use of the below details to start developing a Yocto build to engineer the device firmware builds based on RDK Yocto build setup.

Yocto based RDK builds are flexible enough to easily accommodate SoC & OEM changes. The starting point for the Yocto builds are a manifest file. The manifest file is an xml file that contains details of the different open embedded Yocto build layers, meta layers , rdk as well as open source components that needs to be fetched during initial stages ( than during bitbake time ) as well as the URL locations from where the data can be pulled. A set of sample manifests that can be used as a template for developing OEM specific manifests are given below

### SoC/OEM meta-layer creation

To match the layered structure of Yocto builds, a OEM specific layer is used to include OEM changes and additions. Use the yocto-layer create sub-command to create a new general layer.

|
`$ yocto-layer create mylayer`  |

There shall be separate device (machine) configuration file (.conf) for each device for the particular OEM for which the layer is intended for.The general naming terminology for OEM layer is meta-rdk-oem-<oem name>

The device (machine) configuration file shall include corresponding include (.inc) file to get machine configuration details.

<br>

Click here for more details on SoC/OEM meta-layer creation

#### **Adding the Machine Configuration File for the new OEM**

Each meta-* layer should have a conf folder containing the machine configuration we can select during 'source setup-environment' . O ptionally it can also have a class/classes folder for keeping information that is useful to share between metadata files.

To add a machine configuration, you need to add a .conf file with details of the device being added to the conf/machine/ file. In the machine conf file the basic machine configuration should be defined.

OEM can have several meta-rdk-<oem> layers containing chip specific implementation.

Generally conf file name will be SoC name. If both OEM and SoC are present then machine configuration should be coming from master i.e. OEM . It means whatever image that gets created comes from meta-rdk-oem

<br>

The most important variables to set in this file are as follows :

* Include .inc's ,basically these inc's are from SoC layer and these .inc's are platform dependent.
* Fill the MACHINEOVERRIDES (Eg: If it is media client, give client name)

|
`MACHINEOVERRIDES=` `" "`  |

* For particular SoC build , if they are overwriting any kernel version or gcc compiler version or whatever preferred should be defined in machine conf file.

For SoC, The most important variables to set in this conf file are as follows :

|
`TARGET_ARCH (e.g.` `"arm"` `)` `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual` `/kernel` `(Eg:` `"linux-<chip set name>"` `)` `MACHINE_FEATURES (e.g.` `"apm screen wifi"` `)` `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE (e.g.` `"uImage"` `)` `IMAGE_FSTYPES (e.g.` `"tar.gz ext4"` `)`  |

<br>

#### **Basic configuration of building kernel**

Standard meta-rdk/recipe-core/images will have different kinds of images which one can use and build.

This recipe-core/images will have bbappend or main image name. If meta-rdk is used( i.e. meta-rdk image ) then bbappend of that image client is required

For example,

_<image name>.bbappend_

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg)Define "bbappend of images" and "conf file" as required.

<br>

#### **Adding Recipe for SoC/OEM**

The following kind of recipes can be added to SoC/OEM layer. The recipes shall be grouped as described in "BSP Reference Layer".

* recipes (.bb) to build Kernel
* recipes(.bb) to build SDK
* Kernel patches (SoC/OEM specific - if any)
* SDK patches (SoC/OEM specific - if any)
* Any SoC/OEM specific scripts or files which need to be installed in RF

<br>

<br>

## **TDK and RDK Certification Suite Package**

***

RDKM offers an in-house Test & certification suite that facilitates OEMs to get their IP based product certified as RDK Compliant device.

Certification program includes testing which validates the RDK stack on the device with defined test suite called as RDK Certification Test Suite. It is mandatory to go through this program in order to brand user's platform as RDK compliant product.

Certification suite is available at [RDK IP Set-top Product Certification](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Certification)(only for RDK licensee) and for TDK test app please refer [TDK-V Documentation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK-V+Documentation).

## **SDK Releases**

***

Once the RDK bring-up in SoC is completed, the software is delivered to OEM by the SoC vendors. This usually happens in 2 ways:

### HAL + SDK binary

In this approach will make use of the RDK Artifactory server. Artifactory server is a Repository Manager that functions as a single access point organizing all the binary resources including proprietary libraries, remote artifacts and other 3rd party resources. It is a secure and restricted server, only collaboration members will have access to this server. OEM secure information can be hosted in Artifactory server.

OEM vendors will work in collaboration with the SoC vendor. SoC vendor can define a HAL layer, share the source of HAL & yocto meta layer that can be stored in RDK CMF Git repository,share the SDK binary that can be stored in RDK Artifactory (Shared only from authorized SoC vendors who will work in collaboration with the OEM vendor) and then publish necessary documentation on how to build the OEM SDK. OEM vendor can use the git/ Artifactory for periodic updated (for releases) or for bug fixes. All the source code, binary and documentation will be strictly access restricted and access will be allowed only for authorized personnel by OEM vendor.

<br>

Artifactory server can be accessed by adding the Artifactory details and login credentials in the .netrc file, just like it is done for normal git repositories. A sample is given below:

> machine your.artifactory.host<br>
login YOUR_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME<br>
password YOUR_PASSWORD_OR_KEY_OR_TOKEN

### Complete source code

in this approach, OEM vendors will work in collaboration with the SoC vendor. SoC vendor can define a HAL layer, share the source of HAL & yocto meta layer that can be stored in RDK CMF Git repository and then publish necessary documentation on how to build the OEM SDK.OEM vendor can use the git/ Artifactory for periodic updated (for releases) or for bug fixes. All the source code, binary and documentation will be strictly access restricted and access will be allowed only for authorized personnel by OEM vendor.

For both approaches, the RDKM collaboration zone will be used with strict access restrictions.

<br>

## **Collaboration with SoC**

***

After a successful bring up of RDK on SoC platform, the next step will be to allow SoCs to work with OEMs to get a device based on the SoC platform. RDKM offers collaboration space for OEMs which would help OEMs to collaborate with SoC and RDK teams (as well as any 3rd party) in their journey to engineer a successful RDK product. RDKM collaboration zone includes features like (but not limited to) CMF facility to maintain build manifests as well as SoC/OEM specific code, SoC SDK artifact storage facility, JIRA & RDK Wiki spaces, integration with Test & Certification suites, monthly & release tagging etc.

Please refer [RDKM On-boarding](#rdkvideodocumentation-rdkmon-boarding)for more details on facilities available for SoCs and OEMs as part of collaboration zone . In short, it will include:

* Access restricted Git repositories and Artifactory servers
* Access restricted Confluence and JIRA spaces for Management and Documentation
* Access to RDKM support as well as extended documentation
* Access to test & certification support

# **Procedure for OEM porting of RDK**

The aim of this document is to explain the procedure for OEM porting of RDK.

<br>

### **Step 1 : Selection of SoC board with RDK ported on it**

Refer this page [SoC Platform Firmware](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/SoC+Platform+Firmware) to know the details about Yocto manifests, SoC meta-layer creation includes a dding the Machine Configuration File for the new SoC .

### **Step 2 : Add OEM components**

OEM needs to add OEM specific components like Firmware Upgrade, Secure Boot Loader, MFR libraries, Vendor Specific Information, NVRAM files and partition, Provisioning, OEM Specific drivers, STB Utilities, RDK Device-Specific Patches, Image Generation Utiities etc. as well as interfacing layers to the generic RDK for relevant OEM code modules ( see below )

### **Step 3 : Upgrade RDK/SoC components for OEM changes**

Any Revision change in SoC layer is usually done by SoC's build environment and the new SDK or revision is updated in recipe. If a new recipe is added for any update in SoC software, then can be handled using PREFERRED_VERSION Yocto flag in meta layer

## **C** **omponents of** **OEM Interface**

***

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth Manager implements the Bluetooth HAL i.e. Bluetooth Core (BTRCore) API. Bluetooth HAL interface provides a software abstraction layer that interfaces with the actual Bluetooth implementation and/or drivers. RDK Bluetooth HAL layer enables projects to pick any Bluetooth profiles as per their requirements. Bluetooth HAL uses BlueZ5.42 stack which is a quite popular Linux Bluetooth library.

* Bluetooth HAL - Provides APIs to perform Bluetooth operations by abstracting and simplifying the complexities of Bt-Ifce (& BLuez)
* Bt-Ifce - Abstracts Bluez versions and serves as a HAL for other Bluetooth stacks - Interacts with Bluez over DBus
* Bluez - Interacts with kernel layer bluetooth modules

#### **Modules**

[Operator Checklist](#rdkvideodocumentation-operatorchecklist)

# **Before You Begin**

## **RDK License**

Operators are advised to get into an agreement with RDK Management LLC to obtain the free license so as to use the complete RDK Code base in their platform. More details about license is available at [https://rdkcentral.com/licenses/](https://rdkcentral.com/licenses/). Please email [info@rdkcentral.com](mailto:info@rdkcentral.com)if you have additional questions about licenses or membership

# **Overview**

<br>

Operator can choose preferable device from OEM and also get details from SoC vendors, SoC vendors will already have RDK ported on top of their SoC so they will be having all the features supported in SoC so based on that Operator's can select a OEM with preferred SoC platform and then they can start integrating features that Operator requires on top of the OEM layer so that they can have final product.

<br>

This document will detail the recommended step by step procedure of adopting RDK by a Operator.

<br>

# **Operator Checklist**

***

## **Product Specifications**

***

The first step to get a fully functional product is to define the product features and see if they meet the standard requirements. See [here](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-V+Features)to know what are all the features available in RDK-V and can implement based on your requirement. Operator can use this as a guide while engineering the RDK Operator platform.

<br>

## **Device Firmware**

***

Operators can make use of the details available below to start developing a Yocto build to do the final additions of Operator specific changes to the device. This will help Operator to add their own final product features as well as Operator specific patches/changes.

### Yocto Manifests

Yocto based RDK builds are flexible enough to easily accommodate SoC / OEM / Operator / third party changes. The starting point for the Yocto builds are a manifest file. The manifest file is an xml file that contains details of the different open embedded Yocto build layers, meta layers , rdk as well as open source components that needs to be fetched during initial stages ( than during bitbake time ) as well as the URL locations from where the data can be pulled. A set of sample manifests that can be used as a template for developing Operator specific manifests are given below

<br>

**1**  |

[Device Specific Manifest](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/download/attachments/162767508/device_specific_manifest.xml.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633963194000&api=v2)  |

This is the starting point of the build and is specific to a device/board . If the SoC/OEM has only one target device /board, still it is recommended to maintain a different manifest for SoC/OEM for keeping it future-proof. Usually it contains references to other manifest files which will be having specific set of repos  |
|

**2**  |

[SoC Manifest](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/download/attachments/162767508/soc_name_layers.xml.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633963197000&api=v2)  |

This manifest contains meta layer details of OEM and , optionally, some OEM specific repos  |
| **4** | Operator Manifest | This manifest contains meta layer details for operators and , optionally, some operator specific layers. |
|

**5**  |

[OE layers Manifest](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/download/attachments/162767508/oe-layers-rdk-next.xml.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633963195000&api=v2)  |

This manifest has details of the basic Yocto Open Embedded layers  |
|

**6**  |

[RDK-V Manifest](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/download/attachments/162767508/rdkv.xml.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633963195000&api=v2)  |

This manifest can contain meta layers specific to RDK & RDK-V and , for EXTERNALSRC cases, the RDK & RDK-V component repo details too. It might be supplemented with a conf file too  |
|

**7**  |

Third party Apps manifest  |

This manifest can contain meta layers related to premium streaming applications which are chosen by Operator  |

<br>

The default manifest repo in RDKM Git is at [https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/#/c/manifests/](https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/#/c/manifests/) . Operator need to have their own manifest file in this location which will be mentioned in the 'Device specific manifest' - which is the starting point of builds for a particular target device

### Operator meta-layer creation

To match the layered structure of Yocto builds, a Operator specific layer is used to include Operator changes and additions. Use the yocto-layer create sub-command to create a new general layer.
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `$ yocto-layer create mylayer` |

There shall be separate device (machine) configuration file (.conf) for each device for the particular chip family for which the layer is intended for. The general naming terminology for Operator layer is meta-rdk-<soc name>

The device (machine) configuration file shall include corresponding include (.inc) file to get machine configuration details.

<br>

#### **Adding the Machine Configuration File for the new Operator**

Each meta-* layer should have a conf folder containing the machine configuration we can select during 'source setup-environment' . O ptionally it can also have a class/classes folder for keeping information that is useful to share between metadata files.

To add a machine configuration, you need to add a .conf file with details of the device being added to the conf/machine/ file. In the machine conf file the basic machine configuration should be defined.

Once the conf files are in place, the layer details need to be added to the corresponding package group file. Based on platform, the package group file will be grouped into multiple files with one bitbake fiile and multiple append files. Operator can add the Operator layer details to required package group append files applicable to the target device build to get the features into the final build

<br>

## **Operator Specific Apps**

***

Operators will be having a range of Operator specific applications from simple generic device information apps to Operator specific content applications. RDK's Yocto based layered structure allows Operators to easily integrate, upgrade and maintain their apps in their RDK based IP Set-top devices. For more details on App support in RDK, please refer [Applications](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+-+Applications)(only for RDK licensee) as well as [Operator Platform Firmware](#rdkvideodocumentation-devicefirmware)for the engineering details.

<br>

## **Operator Specific UI**

***

RDK supports usage of multiple User Interface in the RDK IP Set-top devices. Operators can choose from among the already available UIs that are available with RDK as well as develop and use their own UI.

Follow the below steps to get Lightning UI running in devices:
Steps to deploy lightning UI

## Clone and Build Instructions

This section details about how to customize the current UI source code and develop further.

Follow the commands to run the application on you laptop.

RDK Accelerator Home UI version 3 uses Lightning SDK Plugins and it is the latest version of the RDK reference UI which provides a full featured UI with a modern minimalistic design using a dark theme. To use and to know more about RDK Accelerator Home UI please refer [Accelerator Home UI - v3](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Accelerator+Home+UI+-+v3)

<br>

For more information on UI support in RDK, please refer [RDK Video Accelerator - User Interface](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+-+User+Interface).

Based on resident app reference implementation Operator need to bring up the UI.

<br>

## **App Support**

***

Along with the Operator specific apps, Operator can support a lot of generic apps in RDK IP Set-top devices by taking advantage of RDK Support for Native as well as Web Apps in IP based Set-top platforms. Operator can easily port native apps in their platforms (for some third party apps, Operator need to obtain certification from those third party) or can host their own app store and then use Web Apps to show content. For more information on App support in RDK, please refer [Applications](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+-+Applications) (only for RDK licensee).

<br>

## **Provisioning Support**

***

Operator needs to add provisioning support in device so that Device provisioning can be done once deployed at customer premise. The steps for this varies based on platform as well as Operator type.

Provisioning support refers to the scenario such as when you launch Sample app on your mobile it takes to login page and so you have to login there, account there i.e. actually the app has to authenticate your login.

<br>

## **Disaster Recovery**

***

Disaster recovery is an inevitable part of the CPE life cycle. Operator, based on their disaster recovery strategy, could add support for this in the device. While there are some generic guidelines followed across industry, there is no single step that works for all. Operators could easily add their business logic to RDK as part of Operator firmware engineering as described in [Operator Platform Firmware](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/MSO+Platform+Firmware).

As an operator they have to handle crashes/disaster happens and support any factory reset like OTA upgrade.

<br>

## **Test & Certification of devices**

***

Once the device engineering is completed from Operator side, the device can be test and verified easily by the Certification support provided by RDKM. Details of coverage as well as major cases are explained [here](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Certification) (only for RDK licensee) .

Certification suite is available at [RDK IP Set-top Product Certification](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Certification) (only for RDK licensee) and for TDK test app please refer [TDK-V Documentation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK-V+Documentation).

<br>

In short, t o get an RDK based device to field, Operators need to get

* RDK license
  - Operator has to get a RDK license and then any premium apps porting operators should have a project agreed with the corresponding premium app like for youtube it is google to access premium app/any app's plugin or code implementation for app.
* In case Operator is planning to include third party apps ( like Netflix , Amazon Prime etc. to name a few ) there should be a Commercial License Agreement between operators and premium apps.
* Project agreement with OEM's/ SoC

#### **What Operators get from RDK:**

* Pre-certified stack for third party apps is available in RDK as a _**Common Port Architecture.**_For details see [Common Port for Native Apps](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Native+Apps#NativeApps-CommonPortforNativeApps).
* RDKServices are available to customize RDKService plugin plugout components for all the stacks mainly Bluetooth, Wifi and front panel, power manager, device settings etc, pre-set apps and basic architecture of OTA are available.

#### **What Operators need to do:**

* As an Operator, the certification for the operators device has to be done by them(eg: for premium apps).
* Customization of boot loader for operator specific , operator specific UI, Operator specific any customization on the stack such as Power manager(Power specifications to Set-top box to consume only specified power)
* Some Customization of remote and operator specific operations such as other configurations settings and their persistent areas(like premium app logo size on operator device).
* UI integration with RDKServices and UI Specific customizations
  - Operator specific task on RDK are customization of UI to adopt RDKServices so as part of customization of UI they can refer the resident app implementation. As part of customisation of UI,OTA upgrade is one of the first main point .As an operator they need to get the OTA backend server . Xconf is the RDK recommended OTA method.It is not mandatory this can be optional(Like the firmware update plugin is available there readily they can directly use that infrastructure otherwise they need to configure their headend with the xconf server.)
  - Operator specific requirements has to be implemented by operator ( eg.frontpanel related or any customisation of UI and any such requirements )

# **RDK Video AcceleratorÂ Certification Process Flow**

<br>

Process Flow definition is in progress !

<br>

This section explains about the process involved in RDK Certification Program.

<br>

<br>

**Process flow**

* **Collaboration**
* **RDK Porting**
* **Certification**
* **Acceptance*

<br>

## ![(tick)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/check.svg) Collaboration

This is the first stage of the certification program. User should get an approval from RDKM (RDK Management) before starting the Video Accelerator program. RDKM will share the RDK porting guide and technical requirement guide for porting RDK to user platform.

Collaboration zone (JIRA access, communicator etc.,) will be created for easy communication and co-operation. Collaboration zone facilitates user to communicate with RDKM for any queries or support required on porting TDK, Certification Process, and on executing Certification test suites, etc.,

RDKM will share Acceptance criteria that should be achieved by the user platform.

## ![(tick)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/check.svg) RDK Porting

At this stage, User will port RDK into their platform. RDKM will support user on their technical needs on porting.

## ![(tick)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/check.svg) Certification

User have to run the RDK Certification Test Suite at this stage to ensure RDK porting. User will run the test suites themselves and shared the results to RDKM. So once the RDK porting is completed and the Accelerator is ready for certification after self validation , user can submit it to RDKM. RDKM will perform RDK Certification evaluation to make sure the compliance. More details on certification stage is given below

**Test execution by partner and submitting results:**As mentioned in the stages of program, once RDK porting is completed on the device then user can start running RDK Certification Test Suites. RDKM can guide you in executing test suite as required. Final test results should submitted to RDKM. RDKM will review the results and check if any re-execution of test or clarification is required.

**Test execution by RDKM:** During this stage, RDKM will perform basic sanity testing on user platform and if testing looks good then RDKM will repeat full execution of RDK Certification test suites in its premises with user platform and firmware. Any defects find in this stage will be more costly as there are chance for a minor bug that can be turned into major blocker for product certification. RDKM recommends to execute the RDK Certification suite few times and address any pending issues before submitting the results to RDKM.

In case test results are not meeting the acceptance criteria, RDKM shall advice on the next steps then user may have to rerun the test suites again. This stage may take number of iterations until test results are accepted by RDKM.

User can submit for certification once test results are accepted by RDKM.

## ![(tick)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/check.svg) Acceptance

This is the final stage of certification process. User platform will be certified as RDK compliance device based on the results and process followed.

## RDK Certification Test Suites

RDK Certification Test Suite is a test suite that validates your product against RDK specified device requirements. To help you meet RDK standards and build the best possible product, all devices must go through the RDK testing and certification process before receiving approval for launch.

As mentioned in the certification process flow, once user executes the Test Suites and meets the acceptance criteria, then User will have to submit for Certification to RDKM.

Certification Test Suite is a collection suites to cover variety of testing methods starts from API testing to performance and stability testing. Below are the different sub category from Certification Test Suite.

RDK Certification Suite uses the TDK Test Framework for Test validation, more details are available here : [RDK Certification Test Manager Setup](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Certification+Test+Manager+Setup)

RDK Video Accelerator Device Certification has to start with the self validation process which consists validation using RDK Certification Suite (TDK) and manual test plan ( test cases containing the scenarios which are not automated ).

There are two category of test cases

* Sanity Tests
  - User has to execute both automated and manual sanity test cases first and ensure everything is working as expected .
* Full Validation
  - Before submitting for certification , user have to do full round of validation using RDK Certification Suite (TDK) followed by the manual test cases where automation don't have coverage .

Here describes in detail about the set up and dependencies for the automation validation and also about manual validation test cases.

Prerequisites

* TDK Test Manager set up and familiarization . Refer **Setup & Deployment** and **User Manual** in [RDK Certification Test Manager Setup](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Certification+Test+Manager+Setup)
* Make an understanding on different certification suites and it's test set up and ensure all the test configurations are done for each test suite before starting the execution : Refer different suites details in **RDK Certification Suite** tab under [RDK Video Accelerator Certification](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Certification)
* Ensure TDK is ported and running on the device ( For HAL and Hardware performance suites only ) . Refer :[TDK Porting On Video Accelerator Devices](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK+Porting+On+Video+Accelerator+Devices)
* The WPEFramework running port in DUT ( Eg : 9998 )should be open for JSON based request-response communication from the TDK Test Manager tool.

Test configuration files will be available in this test manager location **fileStore/tdkvRDKServiceConfig/**. By default **sample.config**file and platform specific configuration files (**RPI-Client.config , Video_Accelerator.config**) will be there.

User can also create device name specific configuration file by taking a copy of sample.config file based on device name configured in the TDK test manager because rdk service python framework will look for device name specific configuration file first, if it is not found it takes the common configuration file based on device Type configured in TM. The purpose of device name specific configuration file is to provide support for user when they have to configure for soc /oem based key values , but it is not mandatory .

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) For execution , User can either use platform specific configuration file or device name configuration file .

HAL Cerification

HAL Certification Suite is for validating HAL APIs present in the RDK using TDK . The framework invokes the HAL APIs directly and then validates the APIs using it's return values and output parameters. TDK has test coverage for DS HAL, Bluetooth HAL, Deepsleepmgr, DeepSleepHal, HdmiCec, MFR HAL, PowerMgrHal and WesterosHal . Please find the coverage summary for more details which is inside the test coverage section
Validation Methods

* **HAL API Response*

The HAL scripts mainly use the return value from HAL APIs for validation. The script will determine the status of test based on the value returned by API.

* **Output Parameters from HAL API*

HAL APIs are also get validated using the output parameters. Output(s) from HAL APIs are compared with the expected values set by the test script and validated.

Test Coverage

This
 page gives the coverage for the HAL components testing. Detailed test
case documents with APIs details are given in the below table.Â  HAL
 APIs are validated using TDK test tools as any other RDK components are
 validated using TDK. More details on TDK test framework ( stub and test
 scripts) is given here [Developer Handbook TDK-V](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/Developer+Handbook+TDK-V)
Coverage Summary

All the HAL module test scripts are grouped in a custom test suite called " **RDKVA_HALTestSuite**". User can execute all these HAL test scripts by just selecting the suite name from execution page

Test Setup

HAL Components can be validated using TDK test automation framework. This testing requires a special build with TDK feature enabled.

Like any other White Box validation in TDK, HAL APIs are directly validated in this suite. Validations are mainly done based on the return value and output parameters of the APIs.

Validation Methods

* **Player and Animation Events*

TDK Lightning test apps mainly validates the media operations using the player & animation events.

Eg. Before performing an operation, application sets expected player and animation events internally, then invoke the APIs. Event handlers set the observed events. If expected events are found in observed events list, then test step is set as success. This happens for all the provided operations internally by the application. Finally application sets the result as success if all the individual test steps ( or operations) are success or else overall test status is set as failure.

* **Proc Entry Check*

For the media video tests, proc entry check is also performed if the device under test supports proc files.

ace
Test Coverage

The
 Media Playback & Graphics validation Suite covers video playback as

Robustness Certification

It is important to ensure that the device is stable and provides a consistently reliable experience for the customers. In order to confirm this, it's imperative that the device doesn't experience any crash or stability related issues. To achieve this, the test suite contains several stress test cases such as multiple reboots, stress testing of premium applications, graphical plugins and Life cycle management of different RDK Services. There are testcases for validating the stability of network functionalities also. The main validation mechanisms used in the test suite are RDK Service API and event responses, wpeframework logs and Lightning app logs. The test also ensures the CPU and memory usage of the device while testing.

**Please note that the Stability test scripts will take longer than other test suites. Some of the scripts will take days to complete. So make sure that you have a dedicated setup for this long run. <br>
**
Validation Methods CPU Load

All stability test scripts are monitoring CPU load of device between defined intervals. The CPU load must not exceed a maximum given limit under any stress conditions.
Memory Usage

The test scripts are also monitoring Memory usage during the stress testing. Currently the total memory usage is being monitored and it should not exceed the maximum given limit.
Proc entries of AV decoding driver

To validate the video playback, the scripts are using the proc entries of AV decoding driver from device. The values in the video_decoder file must meet the requirements.
Lightning Application Logs

Stability test framework is using its own Lightning applications to perform some stress testing such as channel changing. The script will get enough logs with all details from the applications which is useful for the validation.
Screen Capture Validation

To validate screen resolution change, scripts will be using the screen capture plugin as an additional validation method.

space
Prerequisites

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) Some stability scripts make use of proc entries to validate the status of audio and video. So the DUT must provide the proc entries to execute those scripts. User must follow the steps given in: [Proc Entry Video Validation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/Proc+Entry+Video+Validation)

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) For Cobalt tests, login to YouTube before test execution.

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) Stability scripts can take days to complete. So make sure that you have a dedicated setup for this long duration script execution<br>

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) SSH to DUT is needed for some of the scripts, so either direct SSH should be possible or user must define a SSH method. Please find more details under **Framework Utilities**section of [RDK Service Stability Test Setup](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Service+Stability+Test+Setup)

![(info)](RDK%20Video%20Documentation%20-%20RDK%20-%20RDK%20Central%20Wiki_files/information.svg) Since some of the scripts will take more than 8 hrs to complete, the MySQL wait_timeout value should be modified in order to get the script log. Please follow the steps given in : [Changing MySQL wait_timeout value](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK+Test+Manager+Setup#TDKTestManagerSetup-MySQL_wait_timeout_change)

Security Validation Suite

Security Validation is done using various open source security testing tools which are installed as part of TDK Test Manager tool. It checks for open port vulnerabilities, SSL certificate verification, Webpage vulnerability and other generic security vulnerabilities. The open source security tools currently being used for security validation are Nmap, OpenSSL and sslscan.
Validation Methods Security related tests
 are validated by comparing the security configurations of DUT and the
execution output of the security tools with the DUT.

#  |

Test Scenario  |

Brief Description  |

Validation Method  |

Script Name  | Remarks |
| 1 |

Port Vulnerability Check  |

This tests checks if the RDK device is susceptible to network port attacks. Nmap 7.60 tool is being used for scanning the TCP/UDP network ports in the device with different scan techniques.  |

The following nmap commands are used to scan the networks in the device to identify the open ports:1. TCP Port Scan

-sudo nmap -sT -p- --open <IP>

2. UDP Port Scan

- sudo nmap -sU -F --open <IP>[Used the -F or fast scan option since UDP scan is taking quite a long time to complete.]

3. Nmap IPv4 TCP Syn scan - nmap -sS <IP>4. Nmap IPv4 TCP Fin scan- nmap -sF <IP>5. Nmap IPv4 TCP Null scan- nmap -sN <IP>6. Nmap IPv4 TCP XMAS scan- nmap -sX <IP>7. Nmap IPv4 TCP Maimon scan- nmap -sM <IP>8.Nmap IPv4 TCP ACK scan- nmap -sA <IP>9. Nmap IPv4 SCTP Init scan- nmap -sY <IP>10. Nmap IPv4 TCP PSH scan- nmap --scanflags PSH <IP>11. Nmap IPv4 TCP URG scan- nmap --scanflags URG <IP>12. Nmap IPv4 TCP FIN+PSH scan- nmap --scanflags FINPSH<IP>13. Nmap IPv4 TCP FIN+URG scan- nmap --scanflags FINURG<IP>

Once the list of open ports are retrieved, the list is compared against a list of whitelisted open ports to identify if any additional ports are open in the device.  |

1. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_CONNECT2. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_UDP3. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_SYN4. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_FIN5. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_NULL6. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_XMAS7. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_MAIMON8. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_ACK9. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_SCTP_INIT10. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_PSH11. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_URG12. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_FINPSH13. RDKV_CERT_SVS_PortScan_TCP_FINURG  | Currently a list of open ports are being maintained and configuredÂ  for each
 platform based on available information. This list needs to be
finalized. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

SSL Certificate Verification  |

-The SSL certificates in the device are verified to check if they are nearing expiry.-Checks the SSL certificates for the public key length greater than the configured key length to list the insecure certificates in the device.  |

-The expiry period of the SSL certificates available in the device are retrieved using OpenSSL tool available in the device. Validation of the certificates is done based on the list of retrieved certificates that are nearing expiry. The below openssl command is used to check the certificate expiry:

openssl x509 -checkend <expiry_period> -in <cert_name>-The public key length of the SSL certificates available in the device are retrieved using OpenSSL tool available in the device.openssl x509 -in <path to certificate> -text -noout | grep "Public-Key"

this will list the certificates having public key length lesser than the configured key length.  |

1.RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckSSLCertificateExpiry2.RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckSSLCertificatePublicKeyLength  | -The expiry period,certificates path and the existence of the expired certificates in device needs to be configured.-The SSL certificate public key length should be configured |
| 3 | Webpage Vulnerability Check |

Security tests checks if the webpage are vulnerable to various attacks based on the security protocol used and the security options enabled for the webpage.  |

Webpage are validated using sslscan tool for checking if various security options are enabled for the communication. The below sslscan command is used:

sslscan <IP:PORT>  |
1. RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckSSLSupportedProtocols
2. RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckTLSCompression
3. RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckTLSRenegotiation
4. RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckTLSFallback | Currently the webpage available in device is a development version and does not use any security protocols |
| 4 | Partition Permission Check | Checks for the existence of securityfs partitionÂ  and permissions set on tmp,shm partitions. |

Mount command is used to list the permission set on the partitions1. mount | grep /tmp2.mount | grep /dev/shm3.mount | grep "security"the list of permissions retrieved will be checked against the permissions configured to identify whether the configured permissions set on corresponding partitions.  | 1.RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckPartitionPermission_TMP 2.RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckPartitionPermission_SHM 3.RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckPartition_SecurityFS | Currently the memory partition permissions are configurable values .It will Vary based on platforms . |
| 5 | SSH Legal banners check | Checks for the existence and contents of SSH banner file | Command used to validate the existence and contents of ssh banner file based on the existence of file configured. [ -f <filename> ] && echo 1 || echo 0 [ -s <filename> ] && echo 1 || Â echo 0 | RDKV_CERT_SVS_CheckSSHLegalBanners | A legal SSH banner is a security policy to ensure the authorized access
to device . This is also platform choice so this is configurable. |
| 6 | Auto mounting status check | Checks whether auto mounting is disabled or not |

Command used to check the auto mounting statussystemctl is-enabled autofsit will give the status whether autofs is enabled/disabled.  | RDKV_CERT_SVS_Check_Autofs_Disabled | This will check the Auto mounting status only if Autofs service is present in the device. |
| 7 | WPA_supplicant file check | Checks whether WPA_supplicant file stores senstitive information like WiFi Password as a plain text | Device needs to be connected to the SSID before checking the file for Wifi Password Command used to check the presence of Wifi Password in WPA_Supplicant.conf file under /opt/wifi/grep -F 'Wifi_Password' /opt/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf this is will list the wifi password,if it is stored as a plaintext. | RDKV_CERT_SVS_Check_WPASupplicant_File_For_WiFiPassword | Currently the test is configurable based on the DUT support for password encryption. |

Premium Apps Performance

This test suite covers basic sanity tests of premium applications such as YouTube. The suite will measure the performance of each application by performing different kind of scenarios. The framework invokes the RDK Service apis directly and verify the performance using the logs from the device. To validate the video playback in these apps, the test scripts make use of audio/video proc entry values provided by SOC. So the device must provide the proc entries for video and audio validation.

Firebolt Compliance Suite

Firebolt Compliance Suite is for validating RDK Video Accelerator device readiness for the premium application porting.

* Pre-certify SOC readiness
* Pre-certify OEM STB readiness

Test Suite validates various functional areas of RDK which are required for premium apps

* Device Settings
* Media pipeline
* Secure Storage
* Display Composition and User Inputs
* DRM Content protection.

Validation Methods

* **Device Settings Validation**
  - RDK Services plugins are used by the premium applications for querying and setting device properties such as display resolutions, playerinfo etc., RDK Service API validations provided by TDK is used here.The main validation checkpoints used are **events from service, logs from device and return values of api calls**.
* **Media pipeline Validation**
  - For the media video tests, **proc entry** check is performed if the device under test supports proc files, along with **return values from api calls**.
  - Test application also uses **gstreamer events** to verify the media playback status.
* **OCDM DRM Validation**
  - Forocdm drm validation we mainly use youtube's EME test suite and DRM protected content playback using UVE AAMP Lightning player app tests (from MVS). This gives 90% coverage on OCDM validation
  - Tests are validated using **player events**and **proc file.**
* **Secure Storage Validation**<br>

  - Forcryptography validation, test application validates interface and implementation elements of cryptography with input/output parameters of the api calls along with return value from api calls.
* **Display Composition and User Inputs**
  - For ESSOS validation, test application validates the basic APIs of ESSOS , the test app is derived from the application essos-sample available in westeros repository.
* **Graphics Validation via Lightning App**
  - For Graphics validation using TDK Lightning App we have reused the animation tests (10 tests) from MVS module.
  - Tests are validated using animation events & FPS

Execution RDK Certification Script Execution

In the execution page, user can execute RDK Certification scripts in Thunder enabled devices only. All the Thunder enabled devices will be shown under RDK-V on the left side of the execution page . There is a visual indication of the device status in the tree view, which indicates one of the following status:

1. Device is FREE
2. Device is NOT_FOUND
3. Device is BUSY (an execution is in progress in the device)
4. Device is HANG

User needs to click on a FREE Thunder enabled device in the execution page, upon which the 'Execute script on <device_name>' view appears as shown below.

User needs to select the 'RdkService' radio button next to 'Select Execution Type' label. Then, user can select 'SingleScript' or 'TestSuite' radio button based on the type of execution they want to do. On selecting 'Single Script' option, RDK Certification scripts will be displayed in the drop-down option next to 'Select Script' to select the script. User can select one or more scripts from the drop-down list for execution. If the user wants to execute a testsuite, they need to select the 'TestSuite' radio button upon which a drop-down list will be shown next to 'Select TestSuite' label. User can select one or more test suite(s) from the list for execution. After selecting the script(s)/suite(s), user needs to click on the 'Execute' button for executing the same.

**Rerun :** If the user wants Test Manager to automatically rerun the failed script(s) (if any) of an execution, they need to check the 'Re-Run on Failure' check box before starting the execution. On doing that, a new execution with '_RERUN_1' appended to the base execution name will get started once the base execution is completed. For example, if 'device-20201007015621' is the name of the base execution, the new execution started will be named as 'device-20201007015621_RERUN_1'.<br>

**Full execution repeat :** If the user wants Test Manager to automatically repeat the execution once the base execution is completed, user needs to click on the 'Full execution' radio button next to 'Repeat Test Type' label. and specify the number of times the execution needs to be repeated in the text box below it (Give any number greater than 1 for execution to be repeated).

**Individual script repeat :** If the user wants to execute each selected script 'n' number of times, they can click on the 'Individual scripts' option and input the number of times they want to repeat each script (Give any number greater than 1 for each script execution to be repeated).. The 'Individual scripts' repeat option is not available for single script execution.

**RDK Certification STB Log Transfer :**'Rdk Certification STB Log Transfer' checkbox option next to 'Execution Options' can be enabled in the execution creation page if user needs to transfer device log files to TM after each script execution. The Log file path must be specified in the configure page "Link log files" with the corresponding module as explained in section : 'RDK Certification Log Transfer Configuration' under 'Configuration' . The transferred log file link can be seen in the execution pop-up once the execution is completed as shown below. User can click on that link to download the log file.

<br>

'Rdk Certification Diagnosis' checkbox can be enabled in the execution creation page if user needs to execute rdkcertification diagnosis script after each test execution. Currently, the diagnosis script checks if the version.txt file is present in the device. The output produced by the diagnosis script will be displayed as a downloadable link in the execution result pop-up next to 'Log Files' as shown in the figure below.<br>

RDK Certification Diagnosis script output

<br>

RDK Certification Performance checkbox can be enabled in the execution creation page if user needs to validate the API invocation performance. On selecting the option, the script will internally calculate the time taken for each rdkservice API call. This calculated time is validated against a predefined threshold value. If the time taken for an API response is longer than expected, the script will throw an exception and stop the execution. This validation can be used to identify the APIs which takes more time to return the response. User can skip this validation by unselecting the RDK Certification Performance option while triggering the execution. The performance details will be available as part of script execution log.
RdkCertification script execution log with performance enabled

'RDK Profiling Alert' checkbox is introduced to add Grafana alert support for RDK Certification scripts. If this checkbox is enabled, TM fetches the alerts received during script execution and print the alerts in the script execution log and also make the test step as FAILURE if alerts are received when the collectd metric value goes above a particular threshold.

Alerts are notifications received in Test Manager from Grafana server if a profiling metric value goes above a particular threshold value. Each Alert received can have either of the 3 states - ok, alerting and no_data. <br>
**ok state** - Alert with state as 'ok' is received from Grafana when the collectd metric value went below the threshold value<br>
**alerting state**- Alert with state as 'alerting' is received from Grafana when the collectd metric value went above the threshold value<br>
**no_data state**- Alert with state as 'no_data' is received from Grafana if no metric data is received from the device<br>

But for receiving alerts and using them, the following pre-requisites need to be satisfied -

1. Grafana-Graphite setup - Grafana and graphite setup needs to be up and running in an Ubuntu VM. To setup grafana and graphite servers, refer the page - [Grafana-Graphite Setup](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/Grafana-Graphite+Setup)
2. collectd must be running in the device sending data to a Grafana/Graphite setup. - To setup the device for running collectd , refer the page - [RDK Video Accelerator Profiling](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Profiling) . Follow the steps in the tab 'Profiling Tools' â 'Collectd'
3. Alert dashboard for the device must be imported in Grafana and Graphite setup - Follow the steps mentioned under 'Dashboards Configuration' and 'Alerts Configuration' tab in the page - [Grafana-Graphite Setup](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/Grafana-Graphite+Setup)

<br>

Script output if alert checkbox is enabled

Script Output and execution result if alert checkbox is enabled can be in either of the following ways -
If no alerts are received

If no alerts ar received, the script output will be as shown below -

If 'ok' or 'no_data' alerts are received

If only ok or no_data alerts are received during script execution, then TM will just append the alerts to the script execution log as shown below. The alerts received during script execution will be written to a log file 'alertData.json' which can be downloaded by clicking on the name under 'Log Files' section

One extra row 'Profiling Metrics' will be displayed under that script in popup. User can click on 'Show' -> 'collectd' to view the alerts received in a table

If 'alerting' alerts are received

If these alerts are received, TM will just append the alerts to the script execution log and make the test step as FAILURE. The alerts received during script execution will be written to a log file 'alertData.json' which can be downloaded by clicking on the name under Log Files section

One extra row 'Profiling Metrics' will be displayed under that script in popup. User can click on 'Show' -> 'collectd' to view the alerts received in a table

<br>

# Known issues and limitations

**Limitations** of RDK Certification scripts execution with TDK Test Manager

* Currently, single execution in multiple devices has not been implemented for RDK Certification execution. (i.e., the user cannot select more than one device for a single execution in the 'Device' input box in the 'Execution' page.)

**Known issue :**

* If "Please select Script/ScriptGroup" message is seen while trying to do execution as shown in the below screenshot, please clear your browser cache and check again.Show Screenshot

# Troubleshooting

Refer the link in case of any issues seen while setting up the test manager - [Trouble Shooting](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK+Test+Manager+Setup#TDKTestManagerSetup-Troubleshooting)

Once TDK Tool set up is complete , how user can verify whether certification scripts are available or not ?

* To ensure that all certification module specific scripts are available, user need to do navigate to **Script**tab and expand the nodes for the certification modules and verify if all scripts are present. Please refer ' **RDK Certification Script View**' under **'Script Configuration**' in [User manual](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/User+manual)for detailed explanation

How to debug if the DUT is not displayed as green in TDK Test manager ?

**1. If the DUT is added as a thunder enabled device in TDK Test Manager then check below things**

*
  - Check WPEFramework running Port number is correctly updated in the device configuration page of TDK Test Manager. Screenshot is given in below image.Refer this image

*
  - In case DUT is still not green in test manager even after giving correct port number in the configuration page, check the wpeframework service status is **active**in DUT . [?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `# systemctl status wpeframework` |
  - If device is not green even after WPEFramework service is active , check whether the WPEFramework running port is open for JSON request-response communication from TDK Test Manager . Try executing the below python script from the **rdk-test-tool/filestore**location in the server where TDK Test Manager has hosted . If the python script output is **FREE**that means device should be green in TDK Test Manager and **NOT_FOUND**output indicates some issues in the JSON request-response communication from TDK Test Manager to the DUT . [?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `python callthunderdevicestatus_cmndline.py <DUT IP> <Thunder Port>` `Eg : python callthunderdevicestatus_cmndline.py ` `192.168` `.` `160.31` `9998` |

As mentioned in the test set up prerequisites , WPEFramework running port should be open for JSON request-response communication from TDK Test Manager then only user can do the executions . It should be like that as part of DUT firmware image .As a work around user can try below command in DUT and check whether thunder enabled DUT is green in TDK Test Manager ,[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `/usr/sbin/ip6tables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport ` `9998` `-j ACCEPT` `/usr/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport ` `9998` `-j ACCEPT` |

**2. If the DUT is not added as a thunder enabled device and tdk agent is running in that then check below things ,<br>
**

*
  - In case TDK enabled image is used for HAL and Hardware Performance Suite execution then check "tdk_agent" process is running on the DUT<br>
[?](#)

|  |
| :---: |
| `ps -ef | grep tdk` `systemctl status tdk` |
  - Check if DUT and Test Manager is connected in the same network. Use below command to check if Test Manager is accessible from DUT. <br>

What are the steps involved in RDK Certification Process?

ANS : These are four stages in RDK Video Accelerator Certification program

* Collaboration(discuss with RDKM)
* RDK Porting
* Certification (executing test suites and reviewing results with RDKM)
* Accepting (Publishing the device as RDK certified)

[RDK Video Accelerator Certification Overview](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/RDK+Video+Accelerator+Certification+Overview)
Whether user have to create any special images for validation?

ANS : TDK Enabled image should be created for validating HAL Validation Suite and Firebolt Compliance Suite.

If TDK is not enabled for the platform user can port TDK by referring the guide for porting TDK on Video Accelerator device [TDK Porting On Video Accelerator Devices](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/TDK/TDK+Porting+On+Video+Accelerator+Devices) which will help in creating TDK enabled image.
How to make the RDK Video Accelerator Certification Test Setup?

ANS : "Test Setup" section of individual Test Suite gives more information on the required Test Setup
Where to find the details of the RDK Certification Suites ?

SOC / OEM have to add any support during RDK Porting to support Certification validation?

ANS :

* For white box validation (HAL Certification) TDK Porting has to be done if not done already.
* Driver proc entries to display the status of drivers involved in AV playback need to be added from SoC. Test suite uses Audio and Video Driver proc entries to check the status of AV playback.

How much time it will take to execute one full round of test execution?

ANS : There are different test suites present in this Certification Test Suite. All the test suites have different execution time. Approximate duration is given here

* Robustness Validation Suite (contains long duration playback, channel change and reboot test etc.,) will take 30 to 40 Hours since the suite verifies the stability of the device & applications.
* Other test suites will take 6 to 8 Hours altogether.

What is Self Validation Process? is that enough for certification?

ANS : Once the RDK Porting on Accelerator is completed , users can utilize the RDK Certification Suite to do Self validation and if the test results meets the acceptance criteria , they can submit the device for Certification to RDKM.

Self validation is a first step before submitting for Certification and that alone is not enough to get the device Certified as RDK Compliant.

Final RDK Certification Suite will be ready by end of Q2 2021 , until that time users can use the Certification for internal validation, official Certification process will be started only once the Certification Suite is completely ready.
When SOC / OEM have to submit for Certification to RDKM?

ANS : Once the RDK porting on Accelerator platform is completed ,users can utilize the RDK Certification Suite to do Self validation and if the test results meets the acceptance criteria , they can submit the device for Certification to RDKM.
How much level of validation user can expect with RDK Certification Suite version 0.1 (Beta Release)?

ANS :

Since this is initial Beta release user can expects basic test scenarios from majority of the test suites. Few test scenarios are listed below

* Major RDK Service (31 plugins) API & Event validations are completed
* Various HAL components are validated (Wi-Fi-HAL, HDMI-CEC HAL, DS HAL, PowerMgr HAL, Deepsleep HAL)
* Basic test scenarios covered for validating Media playback and Animation features
* Basic performance test scenarios for validating browser, app loading time, device CPU & Memory utilization monitoring etc.,
* Test scenarios like multiple reboot test, multiple channel change, long duration test are added for validating device stability.

Why am I not able to push code to Github with my Github login username and password?

**Github** **no more supports direct password login** and allows only **Personal Access tokens**. To generate a new token,

* Goto [https://github.com](https://github.com/ "https://github.com/")-> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens
* Click on Generate a new token. You should be able to see a access new token on your UI.
* Please copy the new token and add it to ~/.netrc file as given below
* machine [github.com](http://github.com/) login <github-handle> password <new github access token>

How to contribute code change to RDK Github repos?

**<u>GitHub Workflow Steps:</u>**

* _Create a Fork_ by simply clicking on the 'fork' button of the repository page on GitHub.
* _Clone your Fork_, the clone command creates a local git repository from your remote fork on GitHub.
* _git clone_ [https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git "https://github.com/username/repository.git")
* _Modify the Code_ in your local clone, and commit the changes to your local clone using the git commit command.
* _Push your Changes_ by invoking the git push command, from your workspace, to upload your changes to your remote fork on GitHub.
* _Create a Pull Request_by clicking the 'pull request' button on the GitHub page of your remote fork.

When I attempt to push changes to my fork of the RDK repository on Github, I receive a 403 Forbidden error.Anything am missing?

<u> **Possible reasons and solutions:**</u>

If you are already using the Personal Access Token and getting a 403, chances are that the _token has auto-expired_.

You can generate a new token in Github by going to "[https://github.com](https://github.com/ "https://github.com/")-> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Tokens", Clicking on "Generate a new token" and then replacing your old token inside the ~/.netrc file with the newly generated one.

How to mask a recipe in a platform build?

Mask the recipe in platform specific MACHINE conf file and run the source command again to build.

For example, to MASK ccsp-gwprovapp-ethwan in Rpi build, add below line in Rpi specific Machine conf file. Add below line in file

" **meta-cmf-raspberrypi/conf/machine/raspberrypi-rdk-broadband.conf "**

**BBMASK .= "|.meta-rdk-broadband/recipes-ccsp/ccsp/[ccsp-gwprovapp-ethwan.bb](http://ccsp-gwprovapp-ethwan.bb/) "**

Run the source command again to build

**source meta-cmf-raspberrypi/setup-environment ->** select respective conf file

Who defines the root filesystem and metadata?Â 

Metadata represents the versions of the various components in a distribution, such as the particular versions of the Linux kernel or libraries. The project supplies an example set of metadata that can generate several example distributions. The actual metadata used for the construction of a custom distribution may be supplied by a commercial vendor or created by an embedded developer. The root filesystem is defined in the metadata for a given build of a distribution.
How to view the dependencies of packages and the resulting growth in code size as packages are added?

There are tools within BitBake that enable this level of details.

* "bitbake -g targetname" creates depends.dot and task-depends.dot files in the current directory. These files show which packages and tasks depend on which other packages and tasks and are useful for debugging purposes.
* "bitbake -g -u depexp targetname" shows results in a more human-readable, GUI style. A simple mount of the resulting root image will show how much storage space is being used.

In addition, the toaster is a new graphical user interface for BitBake that makes these tools much easier to use.

<br>

How to add a package to my project?

As with any complex system, the real answer is _it depends_, but of course that is not very helpful. The simplest method for adding a single package to your build is to add

the below line to `conf/local.conf`:

* IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " package"

Use your own package name in place of **package**. Note the leading space before the package name. If you want to add multiple packages, you can use multiple lines like the above, or list all packages on a single line with:

* IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " package1 package2 package3"

Although If you add in local.conf , that is not permanent change. For permanent addition of that package in final rootfs, you need to be added in image recipe or any package group which is included in the image recipe.
How to handle prebuilts?Â 

Prebuilds are handled internally by Yocto by using sstate-cache. If a prebuilt from a known good build is available, the build can point to that folder via the conf file inside the _./build<buildtype>/conf/_ folder so that the prebuilts are picked up from the location
How long do the builds/single component builds take?

This depend entirely on multiple factors like capacity of build machine, first time build or repeated build in the same work space as well as changes in components on which the component in question depends on( if there is a change, the depending component is first built and then the dependent component ) and hence cannot be answered directly.
What are the commands to build a specific sub-component (WPE, Utopia etc...)?Â 

When you checkout sandbox every component is independently buildable, and bitbake ( OE's build engine) is responsible to identify and sort the component dependency chain and ensure its built along. if you were to build a single component the commands are
<pre>bitbake &lt;component&gt;</pre>

where component is in one to one relation with .bb ( recipe ) file that can be found in the Yocto/OE metadata ( meta-rdk* layers ) e.g. if you were to build rdkbrowser then you would see that its recipe is housed in generic layer called meta-rdk-cmf and recipe is called [rdkbrowser.bb](http://rdkbrowser.bb/)so the command would be

```
bitbakeÂ rdkbrowser
```

However this will only generate CMF component and for packaging it up into final image you still have to build the image component to repackage rdkbrowser

```
bitbake rdk-generic-hybrid-wpe-image
```

would generate the CMF generic image for hybrid devices. it will only rebuild the affected components when building the image if nothing has changed it will not recreate the image.
What
 is  the substitute for rebuild, build-only, skip-package?Â Paying
specific attention to when/if any new source is pulled?

bitbake has division of work into individual tasks for a component. Secondly, the recipes are wired to notice changes in upstream repository as well when you do repo sync. You can use below command to see what all individual tasks are available.
<pre>bitbake -c listtasks &lt;component&gt;</pre>

It will show an output like

```
do_build Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Default task for a recipe - depends on all other normal tasks required to 'build' a recipe
```

```
do_bundle_initramfsÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Combines an initial ramdisk image and kernel together to form a single image
```

```
do_checkuriÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Validates the SRC_URI value
```

```
do_checkuriall Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Validates the SRC_URI value for all recipes required to build a target
```

```
do_clean Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Removes all output files for a target
```

```
do_cleanallÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Removes all output files, shared state cache, and downloaded source files for a target
```

```
do_cleansstate Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Removes all output files and shared state cache for a target
```

```
do_compile Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Compiles the source in the compilation directory
```

You can rerun any of the above tasks

```
bitbakeÂ -C compile rdkbrowser
```

would force recompile of servicemanager, if you wish to perform all the build steps for a component you can do that too by

```
bitbakeÂ -c cleansstate rdkbrowser; bitbake rdkbrowser
```

Similarly, in general you can have:

bitbake <target> -c<task_to_be_executed>

This will ensure do_<task_to_be_executed>() will be called.

task_to_be_executed can fetch, unpack, configure, compile, install, package etc

**If we were to draw parallels**

--rebuild = bitbake -c cleansstate <component> ; bitbake <component>

--build-only = bitbake <component>

--skip-package is delegated to shared state mechanism to figure out at present.
How do we ensure that source code is not updated unless user does an explicit code fetch using repo sync or a similar command?

Unless you do 'repo sync' sources will not be updated

'repo sync' can cover only components with external src support, it means that in cases when SRCREV is set to AUTOREV and component doesn't support external src, then bitbake will try to update sources from a remote repository during build time.

There is no documentation for AUTOREV, but it's doing only one function - check remote repository for any new sources updates.

|
`AUTOREV =&#xA0;` `"${@bb.fetch2.get_autorev(d)}"`  |

You can prevent this behaviour by changing BB_SRCREV_POLICY variable in you local <sandbox>/conf/local.conf

|
`BB_SRCREV_POLICY =&#xA0;` `"cache"`  |

|
`BB_SRCREV_POLICY` `Defines
 the behavior of the fetcher when it interacts with source control
systems and dynamic source revisions. The BB_SRCREV_POLICY variable is
useful when working without a network.` `The variable can be set using one of two policies:` `cache - Retains the value the system obtained previously rather than querying the source control system each time.` `clear - Queries the source controls system every time. With&#xA0;` `this` `policy, there is no cache. The&#xA0;` `"clear"` `policy is the&#xA0;` `default` `.`  |

Where does ${D}, ${WORKDIR} resolve to?

These are OE metadata variables, bitbake has preprocessing options where it expands all the local bitbake variables so you could take advantage of that option to figure it out

```
bitbake -e rf4ce | grep "^S ="
```

```
bitbake -e rf4ce | grep "^WORKDIR ="
```

It can be used to check for any bitbake variable, alternatively you can pipe the whole bitbake -e output to a file and inspect the file in your favourite editor
How do I locate logs for a particular component in the Yocto/OE folder structure?

* You can find log files for each task in the <u>recipe's</u><u> `temp`</u><u>directory</u>.Log files are named `<u>log.</u><em class="replaceable"><code><u>taskname</u>-Eg:compile logs are present in the file log.do_compile. </code></em>`Bitbake maintains logs separately for each of the tasks that run while building the component. These tasks are typically the fetch task, the compile task, install task and so on.
* Eg: For a RPI device, typically logs are present under the build-raspberrypi-rdk-hybrid//tmp/work/<*-rdk-linux> and under the component directory. Other devices would have logs present under similar folders. For instance, logs are present under <u>build-raspberrypi-rdk-hybrid/tmp/work/<*-rdk-linux>/rdkbrowser/1.99+gitAUTOINC+8c3f17fdc6_fa6c8b4334_dc33f7d6bc_4bc1f2f4c9-r0/temp</u>

How to fix Werror unused parameter warning error during compilation?

The warnings like -Werror -Wall -Wextra are turned on for compiler for most of the Ccsp components .All these warnings must be fixed for successful compilation as all warnings are treated as errors.

Werrors due to unused parameters in code can be fixed by using:

UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(user_data); ,if user_data variable is not used in the scope of definition of the function .
How to solve the error occured during enabling net-snmp in device?

```
* satisfy_dependencies_for: Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for packagegroup-...:
```

```
* Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  net-snmp *
```

```
* opkg_install_cmd: Cannot install package packagegroup-....
```

**The above error indicates that :**

You asked for adding net-snmp ( the package ) not ( the recipe ) now net-snmp ( the recipe ) may generate a number of ( packages ) so you should add the packages ( runtime items) to the package groups and not the recipes ( build time items). Usually yocto/OE does generate a output package with same name as input recipe so for [net-snmp.bb](http://net-snmp.bb/)there will be a net-snmp ipk but thats just a common case not a hard and fast rule.

Now in this particular case when a package has nothing to emit into the ${PN} package the package is left empty and hence not emitted. If you want to emit the package regardless you have to add
<pre>ALLOW_EMPTY_&lt;package&gt; = &quot;1&quot; in the recipe,<span>but this is less of a usecase to demand empty packages. If you expressed the packagegroup RDEPENDS correctly you </span>would not need it.</pre>If my workspace has a large sstate-cache, how can I make it lean ?

sstate-cache is always adding new versions and hence is growing in size always, thankfully we have a tool in Yocto to manage it, here is a sample on how to do it for **raspberrypi** you can set WORKSPACE and MACH variables to point to the values for machine<br>
**sstate-manage.sh**

How to enabled/disable kernel/busybox features in Yocto?Â 

To enable kernel/busybox features you can append metadata to the recipes (i.e. .bb files) by simply creating an append file (i.e. .bbappend files) and including metadata in it. If the features needs to be enabled across all the platforms then add in **meta-rdk-rpi** meta or if it's specific to a platform then append to the recipes available in OEM layer specific to the platform.

Below example shows how to enable IPSec on Yocto builds:

* Create a stblinux_%.bbappend
* Create a file called enable_netkey.cfg with following content <br>
CONFIG_NET_KEY=y
* Add SRC_URI_append = " "

Make sure .bbappend has the same root name as their corresponding .bb recipes.
How
 toÂ resolveÂ repoÂ syncÂ failures when the branch is
few commits behind the master or when it has uncommitted changes?

* Sometimes when you have a working branch which is not checked out or has uncommitted changes then repo will fail when you try to sync to the latest code base.
* Sample failure logs:

error: generic/devicesettings/generic/: contains uncommitted changes

error: generic/rdkbrowser/: branch master is published (but not merged) and is now 11 commits behind

error: meta-rdk-oem-X/: contains uncommitted changes

* To resolve this you need to checkout the branch and rebase it to the master using below commands.

git rebase âabort

git rebase rdkgerrit/master ( or rdkgerrit/stable2)

* During the process git might throw conflict errors if it cannot merge files automatically. Then you need to merge manually using Vim or any other text editors. But it can be simple if you know exactly what changes needs to be saved / removed.
* For example you can use below command to keep your changes

git checkout --ours FILE

* If you want to run on multiple files then use below command.

grep -lr '<<<<<<<<'. | xargs git checkout --ours

* Similarly, you can use below commands if you want to keep other changes.

git checkout --yours FILE

How to move files under PACKAGES to "-dev" pacakge to use for development and debugging purpose?

* Verify the files from which recipe they are being generated under build-<platform>/buildhistory/packages/mips32el-rdk-linux folder
* Add the below line format under that particular recipe.

FILES_${PN}-dev += " file1 file2 etc"

* Verify that _cat <package>-dev/latest_should contain these files under FILELIST.

How do I find which package provides a file in target file system?

Yocto project build system has a utility which can provide information about which package (ipk or rpm) is providing a given file, this helps in finding further information on packaging e.g. if you want to do more finer packaging, run the following command in your build environment

oe-pkgdata-util find-path /lib/[libc.so](http://libc.so/).6<br>
glibc: /lib/[libc.so](http://libc.so/).6
How to debug a common build failure seen during rootfs creation?

Common build failures are reported in Yocto builds. Some build failures are hard to analyze with logs, unless we get access to the failure workspace. In most cases they are hard to reproduce on local workspace. We go through multiple iteration of builds, lock down the node and then debug. To debug these failures use Packages file found under _tmp/deploy/ipk_directory on you local workspace .
how to enable GDB in build?

The signal core dump that are generated under /tmp can be decoded using gdb<br>
<u>Procedure :</u>

1. In <image>.bbappend file<br>
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " gdb"
2. In local.conf<br>
INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE = "GPL-3.0 LGPL-3.0 AGPL-3.0"<br>
INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE_pn-gdb = ""<br>
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "tools-debug"<br>
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "dbg-pkgs"
3. In <component>.bbappend<br>
CFLAGS += " -D_DEBUG -g "
4. Compile and flash the binary to device
5. Run gdb -c <path to signal dump> <binary>

How to solve this Build issue - Platform target mismatch Error: File format not recognized?

This should be because of architecture bit mismatch . To overcome this should either choose the right target platform or put the executable file as a tar file in bb file.
How
 to resolve insufficient storage space issue in the build host""ERROR:
No new tasks can be executed since the disk space monitor action is
"STOPTASKS"?

**<u>Issue:</u>**

While building the stack, the bitbake process will be aborted if the disk space runs low beyond the minimum requirement.

**<u>Example console log:</u>**

WARNING: The free space of /mnt/home/gpsahu01/cmf/test/build-qemux86hyb/tmp (/dev/vdb) is running low (0.999GB left)

ERROR: No new tasks can be executed since the disk space monitor action is "STOPTASKS"!

WARNING: The free space of /mnt/home/gpsahu01/cmf/test/downloads (/dev/vdb) is running low (0.095GB left)

ERROR: Immediately abort since the disk space monitor action is "ABORT"!

NOTE: Sending SIGTERM to remaining 1 tasks

<u> **Possible solution:**</u>

Yocto stack requires more than 30 GB of free disk space for build to complete, so it is required to keep sufficient disk space available before starting the build process.
How to resolve missing "sys/cdefs.h" issue in random recipe files which might give "ERROR: oe_runmake failed" error?

**<u>Issue:</u>**

Bitbake complains about a missing "sys/cdefs.h" and the error can be encountered in random recipes when we move from one build host to other.

[<u> **Possible Solution:**</u>](https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/manifests)

This issue may be caused by a missing "g++-multilib" package in the build host (observed in Ubuntu 14.4). Installing the package with "sudo apt-get install g++-multilib" should resolve this issue. Also the build machines should be configured following the procedure as per Setup guide to avoid similar issues.
Bitbake

with "ERROR: Function failed","ERROR: ParseError"? How to resolve this?

**<u>Issue:</u>**

The bitbake process terminates after complaining about a non-existent path or environment variable.

**<u>Example console log #1:</u>**

ERROR: Function failed: iarmbus: LIC_FILES_CHKSUM points to an invalid file: ${RDK_ROOT_PATH}/components/generic/iarmbus/core/include/libIARM.h

<u> **Possible solution:**</u>

This may be due to a wrongly setup environment e.g. we have executed "meta-rdk/setup-environment" instead of sourcing "meta-cmf/setup-environment"
Bitbake fails with "fatal: Not a git repository" after selection of option in meta-cmf/setup-environment, and why?

**<u>Issue:</u>**

Network related issues a) How to resolve "Fetch failure/ timeout errors" Eg:"error: Exited sync due to fetch errors"?

**<u>Issue:</u>**

Fetch timeout or failure can happen due to following network problems.

- Network not accessible

- Restriction in Firewall

- Invalid Proxy configuration

- Unable to resolve DNS in IPv6 networks

**<u>Example console log:</u>**

<u> **Possible solution:**</u>

- Using VPN may have some restrictions sometime it may not allow GIT access.

- Ensure that the ports for HTTPS, SSH, HTTP are opened by the firewall and the policy doesn't block common open source repositories.

- In case of IPv6 networks issues, force GIT to use IPv4.

Also Following options can be considered while debugging:

**Option #1)** Need to flush the IP rules: <br>
enter the command <br>
$ iptables -F<br>
and check <br>
$) git clone [git://git.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/lighttpd-1.x.git](git://git.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/lighttpd-1.x.git)

**Option #2)** Check for the port 22 is open or not by doing nmap<br>
$ nmap -p 22 10.11.107.0-255" <br>
(check for ipaddress 10.11.106.62)<br>
$ ssh -v [git@github.com](mailto:git@github.com)<br>
if it adds it will ask for input()yes/no- Type yes<br>
$ git clone [git://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4.git;branch=lighttpd-1.5.x](git://github.com/lighttpd/lighttpd1.4.git;branch=lighttpd-1.5.x)

**Option #3)** replacing the git// with https:// which uses port 443 <br>
$ git config --global url."https://".instead of git://<br>
and try $ "git clone [git://git.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/lighttpd-1.x.git](git://git.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/lighttpd-1.x.git)"

**Option #4)** in a few cases, the access to GIT repository is via SSH. To use SSH URLs with GIT repository, an SSH key-pair must be generated on the build PC and add the public key to your GitHub account. <br>
For information on setting up an SSH key-pair, see "Generating an SSH key."<br>

**<u>Issue:</u>**

When we try to build a very old branch of the code, the manifest file will not be up-to-date as few of the open-source URLs might not be continuing support of older branches or versions of software.

**<u>Example console log:</u>**

[<u> **Possible Solution:**</u>](https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/manifests)

**Temporary workaround:** In case of archives (.tar or .zip etc.), if the file is available from a previously built stack then it can be copied and an empty file with the name <archive-name>.done has to be created to bypass looking for downloading the file.

**Fixing the recipe:** If the problematic recipe is available from any other alternative mirror, update the same in SRC_URI part of the recipe. Few components may be available in common mirrors such as github, [web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org/), [oipf.tv](http://oipf.tv/) etc.

How to enable/disable a FEATURE in build?

To include a specific feature that is not available in base build, enable the feature specific DISTRO flag in platform specific config file. For example to include USPA feature in Rpi build,

Add the DISTRO specific flag in Rpi platform specific conf file

In File **meta-cmf-raspberrypi/conf/distro/include/rdk-rpi.inc**

Add **DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " usppa" (to include the feature if not there)**

**DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = " usppa" (to remove the feature)**

<br>

**Make sure the recipe is part of the package build**

In File **meta-rdk/recipes-core/packagegroups/[packagegroup-rdk-ccsp-broadband.bb](http://packagegroup-rdk-ccsp-broadband.bb/)**must be included as a DISTRO protected feature **RDEPENDS_packagegroup-rdk-ccsp-broadband += " \ ${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'usppa', "usp-pa", "", d)}"**

Random issues appearing when the previous build process was aborted

**<u>Issue:</u>**

Bitbake fails on populate sysroot state when building with an un-clean stack.

**<u>Example console log:</u>**

<u> **Possible solution:**</u>

This may happen when a previous build process was unexpectedly terminated or aborted. Re-build after cleaning the problematic recipe or image (bitbake <recipe> -c cleanall) would fix the issue.
Issues related to patching (ERROR: Function failed: patch_do_patch)

**<u>Issue:</u>**

Bitbake terminates the compilation process on 'do_patch' task. This may happen in following cases:

- When using an old recipe file where the SRC_URI link has updated its folder structure.

- Wrongly formatted patch file (run dos2unix for conversion)

- Incorrect patch level (p0, p1, etc.)

**<u>Example console log:</u>**

[<u> **Possible Solution:**</u>](https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/manifests)

From the above output it seems that the file to which patch will be applied is not found, possible reason may be the source folder structure doesn't match with the destination folder structure. E.g. the source directory or **${S}** starts from the relative path **'src'** folder and we are trying to patch outside of it.

By default bitbake patches the files with patch level 'p1' so creating a patch file which matches destination folder structure would solve this issue. Another option is to alter the patch level. E.g.

**SRC_URI +=** **[file://docsis_3383.patch;striplevel=0](file:///)**
Invalid md5sum error (md5sum mismatch in recipe,ERROR: gst-plugins-playersinkbin-noop: md5 data is not matching)

**<u>Issue:</u>**

Bitbake complains about md5sum mismatch when a recipe has retained old md5sum value while the source file is updated.

**<u>Example console log:</u>**

ERROR: gst-plugins-playersinkbin-noop: md5 data is not matching for [file://gstplayersinkbin.c;md5=0f518921aef846c156f91ce4dd6b7c76](file:///) <br>
ERROR: gst-plugins-playersinkbin-noop: The new md5 checksum is 958142c8f2783c6c4f357f561585b4da

<u> **Possible solution:**</u>

Update the new md5sum value of the file in recipe. This can be done using following steps:

:.../meta-rdk/recipes-extended/gst-plugins-playersinkbin/files$ md5sum -t gstplayersinkbin.c<br>
958142c8f2783c6c4f357f561585b4da gstplayersinkbin.c

Now change the above value in recipe:

LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "[file://gstplayersinkbin.c;md5=958142c8f2783c6c4f357f561585b4da](file:///) \"

Few points to check here,

* First check if the SRC_URL can be accessed manually in browser
* Check the path of the URL is proper and check the branch detail as well

For example, above error can be fixed by appending **branch=main** in the SRC_URL path

Why it is not possible to access webpage to view the live streaming content to check RMS feature?

AS of now we used confidential page to check this feature,we are trying to support google based signalling server to resolve this conflict.
Which "Encoded" format supported for RMS liver streaming and CVR?

h264 encoded format is supported for RMS live streaming and Continuous video recording(CVR).

Does the RDK license cover the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA)?

No. An organization must be a member of the [Digital Living Network Alliance](http://www.dlna.org/) to obtain a DLNA license.
As there is no Digital Media Server in RDK, which module provides content for DLNA?Media-streamer
 module provides content for DLNA. The implementation is a part of the
media-streamer component, and is implemented on top of the libgupnp
code.Do the RDK Servers run with DLNA link protection?

Yes.
How do I download old versions of rdkv-xxxxqx?

how to add event listeners and subscribe the available events in dash.js?

It is possible to consume mediaplayer events in Lightning

Example:

const events = ["playbackStateChanged", "playbackCompleted", "playbackSpeedChanged",

"playbackFailed", "mediaMetadata", "timedMetadata", "playbackProgressUpdate",

"playbackStarted", "bufferingChanged", "durationChanged", "decoderAvailable" ];

events.forEach(event => {

player.addEventListener(event, (e) => {

this.fire(event, {event: e});

});

});
In which scenarios an application need to use service manager API if IARM Bus interface is already available?

IARM bus interface are used to get the events notification from the system level like IR key, power, storage space, etc. could be better used in native apps.

Servicemanager acts as a subscriber who will receive the events from IARM Bus and post it to MSO Backend. The ServiceManager is the one well known facility for cloud-based applications to gain access to device vended functionality whether they are written in HTML .
If one has to write a new Service for ServiceManager, would the base class be Service, or AbstractService?

The better alternative is of course the "AbstractService" class as it is the newer version and derived from the "Service" class and has a superset of features of the service class. However, pure virtual functions may be useful for enforcing OOPS convention of data hiding and abstraction.
How
 to add new parameters to TR069 data model? Which files needs to be
modified in order to "see" the parameters on the emulator?

First modify the config/xml file which will be there in the component you are writing objects and then respective handlers you have to call in xml.
Does WPE support Web Assembly?

* WPE doesn't support WebAssembly.
* It wont be faster for general use cases and memory management is worse since it's a fixed heap without garbage collection.
* Web assembly is interesting but currently they're targeting big monolithic codebases in c++ etc like games but more on desktop memory profiles. All the feedback we got thus far has told us their experience hasn't been a win on perf or memory

Does Comcast support canPlayType() for determining codec support?

WPE WebKit has limited support for HTMLMediaElement.canPlayType() and MediaSource.isTypeSupported(). It implements checks for container, video width/height/framerate, and basic verification of codec (it doesn't check for profile & level)
DASH.js has a problem with sending license requests to a playready server,Why?

Make sure DASH.js uses utf-8 as a content type format for license requests (playready challenge is utf-8 encoded)

OPKG shows me only the packages already installed and is unable to update them. What tool can I use to install packages?

There is no package manager support for downloading/installing packages. However you can manually install ipk packages.
Wondered if there was a screen resolution setting to force the rdk hardware to a given resolution?

RDK Device Settings is the component which handles the following configurations:

* Audio Output Ports (Volume, Mute, etc.)
* Video Ouptut Ports (Resolutions, Aspect Ratio, etc.)
* Front Panel Indicators
* Zoom Settings
* Display (Aspect Ratio, EDID data etc.)
* General Host configuration (Power managements, event management etc.)

These properties are persisted in the STB and are read/applied on each boot-up.

For example: On a RDK emulator, the device setting properties are persisted in '/opt/persistent/ds/hostData' .

There are few sample applications available to test/force the settings e.g. setResolution can be used to force the resolution settings.
What are the logging requirements for the Comcast RDK?

The Comcast RDK requires kernel logs, DOCSIS ECM logs, and syslog messages to be logged into specific files. These details can be provided by Comcast on request. The RDK set-top diagnostics and troubleshooting infrastructure requires these logs to be present and accessible via the ESTB interface to aid in the rapid troubleshooting of the device during development and deployment.
Can you clarify the partitioning scheme and other requirements for on-board flash memory and disk drives?

Flash and hard disk drive (HDD) requirements for RDK devices will differ depending on the deployment configuration. For example, a DVR will have an HDD but some other devices will not.

Flash is used to store the advanced bootloader (ABL), primary and secondary firmware images, serialization data, and other data that need to persist, including logs. Where possible on HDD devices, the HDD is leveraged to store dynamic content leaving flash on those devices to be primarily read-only. The partitioning scheme for on-board flash and HDD will therefore differ depending on the physical makeup of the device.

Please contact Comcast for more information.
Do
 libcrypto, openSSL and libpgp need to follow robustness rules in their
implementation, as with DRM? Or are they just ported as is on the
platform? Do they need to be optimized in hardware?

libcrypto, openSSL and libpgp can be ported as it is. However the SoC security APIs need to be implemented to support Comcast security requirements.

There are no requirements for hardware optimization.

After
 building the full Raspberry Pi image, the rootfs doesn't seem to
contain libpcap. So, although the rootfs of emulator build does contain
it. Any specific reason for such difference?

* The rootfs doesn't contain [libpcap.so](http://libpcap.so/), as tcpdump utility is not appended in the packagegroup-rdk-oss-broadband.bbappend file in the Raspberry-pi build whereas you can find the tcpdump utility appended for the corresponding file for Emulator build.
* So, if we include tcpdump utility in the above mentioned file, libpcap. So file will be present in the rootfs of the raspberry-pi build.
* See below output from the raspberry-pi device after adding tcpdump

root@RaspberryPi-Gateway:/# find . -iname libpcap* ./usr/lib/[libpcap.so](http://libpcap.so/).1.7.4 ./usr/lib/[libpcap.so](http://libpcap.so/).1
Is it possible to just download the pre built image of RDK-B that can be loaded onto an SD card without having to build it?

Currently no such pre-built images are available for download. You can follow the simple build instructions to generate your own build.

Eg:

* [RDK-B Raspberrypi - Host SetUp and Build Instructions](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-B+Raspberrypi+-+Host+SetUp+and+Build+Instructions)
* [RDK-B Emulator Build Instructions](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-B+Emulator+Build+Instructions)

Why eRT subsystem fails on emulator?Is this because of the absence of embedded router?

The eRT (embedded router) subsystem is generally used to perform dmcli operations on Raspberry pi which can function as a basic router. To perform dmcli operations in emulator we use simu.
What are the steps involved in compiling the Go Lang application? Do you have yocto recipes for the same?

We're simply building the application using go build (without any Yocto recipes) as shown below -

_env CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc LD=arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build_
Does
 RDK officially support GO Lang compiled binaries? As the base of RDK
seems to be linux, is it safe to assume that, the GO compiled program
binaries will run normally on RDK-B? What are the steps involved in
compiling the Go Lang application?

* RDK officially doesn't support GO language compatibility. But you may always try GO binaries as most RDKM code bases are based on Yocto open-embedded builds and the binaries work out of the box.
* You can simply build the application using go build (without any Yocto recipes) as shown below -
  - _env CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc LD=arm-linux-gnueabihf-ld GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=1 go build_

Which types of data models/namespace are available under the eCM subsystem like "Device.WiFi." under eRT?

* Please refer to [https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/plugins/gitiles/rdkb/components/opensource/ccsp/CcspWifiAgent/+/refs/heads/rdk-next/config-atom/TR181-WiFi-USGv2.XML](https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/plugins/gitiles/rdkb/components/opensource/ccsp/CcspWifiAgent/+/refs/heads/rdk-next/config-atom/TR181-WiFi-USGv2.XML). This gives objects, parameters list for WiFi along with functions call. T he XML file (TR181-WiFi-USGv2.XML) file provides details regarding the data models available under Device.WiFi.
* . In older releases , the XML files are available under /usr/ccsp/<component> . But with the latest code, instead of reading and parsing the XML at runtime, the new approach includes conversion of XML to .C/.cpp with the help of XML2C and creating a shared library ([libWi-Fi.so](http://libwi-fi.so/)).These changes are done for rdkb to reduce image size and improve boot times.

Is there any support for containers in RDK-B as of today?

Please refer [https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDKB+Containerization+in+RPI+-+User+Manual+-+2019+M3](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDKB+Containerization+in+RPI+-+User+Manual+-+2019+M3) .

How to enable debug logs for a component ?

Below are the two ways to enable debug logs for component

1. adding prints in the respective place of code
2. using rdkb logger(LogAgent) .<br>
LoggerEnable - to enable/disable logs for particular component. If it is TRUE logs are enabled otherwise logs are disabled.<br>
LogLevels - To set different log levels for each component. By default all modules log level is 4 (RDK_LOG_INFO).

What are the steps to run valgrind for ccsp components?

The steps are â

* Port valgrind to the platform (if not already available)
* Compile the component with debug symbols enabled (i.e, avoid stripping the component executable/library. alternatively, you may replace the stripped binary with unstripped binary if it is not a read-only image)
* Stop the service and start the binary as part of valgrind (just like we load any normal binary using valgrind)
* Once you have enough data collected (or observed the issue you were trying to debug), you may stop it and examine the xml file for details.

For reference please look into this attachment :

Describe a way to get ipset on RDK-B Emulator?

* ipset is available in real RDK-B devices( like the XB6 devices for example). To enable ipset for RDKB emulator, you can do that as the yocto recipes for ipset are already available at /meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-extended/ipset/[38.bb](http://ipset_6.38.bb/)
* You need to add the recipe to the package group for emulator to use it up during build time (you may add them in ./meta-rdk-bsp-emulator/recipes-core/packagegroups/packagegroup-rdk-ccsp-broadband.bbappend)

How to customize kernel modules for RDK-B emulator?

How
 to know the Ccsp components reside in which subsystems? {e-x,
Device.WiFi. falls under eRT subsystem. likewise for eCM subsystem)

* The eCM and eRT subsystems will always coexists in a **DOCSIS based WAN frontend gateway devices**. Any request for eCM parameters will be routed to eCM Message Bus Adapter component which uses **SNMP or other protocols**to talk to the cable modem firmware in the backend.
* In Rpi, we have only eRT and in emulator we have simu.
* eCM is applicable only to DOCSIS based devices , which uses SNMP based OIDs.

How to test NTP daemon 'ntpd' with RDK-B?

Use NTP sync to run in the background to sync time with NTP servers.Update the NTP servers in ntp conf file if needed.
What is the minimum rdkb hardware requirement and functionalities supported by minimum requirement ?

Minimum Hardware requirement :

* A Raspberry Pi 3B with the below configuration can be an ideal minimum requirement to support most of the functionalities for RDK-B.
* The configuration of RPi 3B is CPU: Quadcore 1.2 GHz Broadcom BCM2837 64bit with 1GB RAM.
* R-Pi 3B would be sufficient for the basic wireless functionality using 2.4GHz. In case of 5 GHz band support R-Pi 3B+ would be good (Note : R-Pi 3B+ doesn't support simultaneous dual band operations).
* Flash: The minimum size is around 285 MB. Anything above this should work just fine for loading/storing the build.
* RAM: As far as the logs/database is concerned, anything around 16 MB should be sufficient.

<br>
The above requirement supports all the basic functionalities of RDK-B.
Is
 RPC-download implementation not included in current RDK-B source code?
After downloading and reviewing RDK-B source code, I can't find the
source code to implement RPC-download to download firmware & make
firmware upgrade. The namespace responsible for RPC-download defined in
tr069pa is "com.cisco.spvtg.ccsp.fu.Configuration.", but no program
registers this namespace.

* RPC download is not supported in RDK-B.
* RDK-B never had "cisco.spvtg.ccsp.fu.Configuration". This part of the code has come through initial code drop and is deprecated.

Can
 we modify wifi configuration of router through command line such as
modifying ssid name, ssid password, wifi security protocol etc in RDK?

Yes. RDKB has the below options to modify SSID name, password, security protocol etc.

* A WebUI, where you can modify these items just like the UI for most normal routers.
* 'dmcli' command line utility which will execute TR69 commands to modify the mentioned items.

Is
 it possible to interact with TR-181 data model with IPC (inter process
communication)?  Assume that there is a service running on RDK-B stack
that wants to change WiFi setting or get the status of WiFi from data
model. If possible, is there any specification available to communicate
with RDK-B stack?

Yes. You can invoke the data models via dmcli commands from your service or via Cdm_GetParam set of APIs from your code. The TR-181 data model specifications that are available in the TR-181 data model XML for each component can be referred.
In
 current source code, the client side MUST install device private key
and certificate files which are pair for ACS certificate, then it
possible to have HTTPS connection with ACS.  HTTPS is not supported in
case of NO device key and certificate files pre-installed, right?

The CA certificate file and device certificate/private key can be configured in ccsp_tr069_pa_cfg.xml for https support.

Duktape is a lightweight javascript engine ([https://duktape.org/](https://duktape.org/)). Alone it does not provide a web development engine like php or node.js. Therefore,on top of duktape there is a templating engine(called jst) and web server api. To make migration as easy as possible the style of templating and api signiture will match php as closely as possible. Many php functions and variables will be rewritten in javascript, so that changes to the exist code is minimized.

What to do if I encounter a Checksum mismatch while building image for RaspberryPi?

Checksum mismatch error is related to Fetcher failure for URL . The ways to fix this error are as follows

1. the url might be deprecated . Hence should use the right URL with right path
2. md5 checksum must be pointing to older one , which should be replaced with the latest checksum
3. if the component is not required ( or not maintained ) , then they can be masked from inc file

How to log  RDK Components to component log files instead of stdout ?

* For this you need to convert all C/C++ logging statements(like printf) to use standard logging functions CcspTraceInfo, CcspTraceWarning,CcspTraceError etc. CcspTraceXxxx functions are based on open-source 'log4c'.
* By using the above apis the logs are automatically written to logfiles.
* After conversion to standard logging functions ,you can verify the logs under /rdklogs/logs/.

<br>

<br>

Is there a consolidated logging system like SYSLOG available?

yes, all logs are maintained in persistent path (opt/logs) log rotation available if size goes beyond. Log server are in place. More details on how logging is done in RDK can be found here: [Log Upload](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Log+Upload), [RDK Logger](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK+Logger)

### Telemetry

***

Do we really need to setup DCM configuration in the Xconf to use telemetry?

Yes, Because telemetry itself is a subset of Device Configuration management aka DCM and we need to configure the DCM logupload settings before setting up telemetry configuration
In
 telemetry 2.0, what is the use of setting up profiles via T2 Report
Profiles(JSON blob with configuration) compared to the legacy telemetry
profiles?

By using T2 Report profiles, we can setup multiple telemetry profiles. Each profile can have different set of telemetry markers , telemetry upload location URL and telemetry upload schedule. The different telemetry JSON data will be uploaded separately. Thus multiple telemetry profiles is achieved.
Will the reports be uploaded to Splunk server/ Telemetry upload server when the T2 Report profiles are set using dmcli command?

Yes, the T2 report profile will have the upload URL along with the telemetry markers, The upload repository in different profiles can be same or different. So based on the configured URL in these T2 report profiles, the data will be uploaded to the respective URLs .

How to configure xconf in local machine?

To know the Complete steps for xconf local setup , Please refer : [Xconf Server - User guide for configuration and feature validation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Xconf+Server+-+User+guide+for+configuration+and+feature+validation)
If
 I wanted to run my Cassandra database on a separate node, where in the
Xconf configuration would I pass in the details for that?

In service.properties, you can add the following properties. The "seeds" property is just a comma-separated list of a few Cassandra hosts. If you are using a single host, then it's just that one. The other properties may not be needed.

connectionPools.SharedConnectionPool.seeds=192.168.0.100,192.168.0.101<br>
connectionPools.SharedConnectionPool.localDatacenter=DC_NAME<br>
connectionPools.SharedConnectionPool.readConsistencyLevel=CL_LOCAL_QUORUM<br>
connectionPools.SharedConnectionPool.writeConsistencyLevel=CL_LOCAL_QUORUM<br>
connectionPools.SharedConnectionPool.autoDiscoverHosts=true
Is
 it possible to run xconf-angular-admin and xconf-dataservice on
separate nodes? If yes, is there any specific configuration that will
basically allow both the services to discover each other?

Yes, it can be run on separate nodes. The admin and data service do not need to discover each other. They both use the Cassandra database, so they need to be able to reach it. If you install the admin and data service on separate nodes, you will probably have Cassandra on a third node. The service.properties file for each service should include the "seeds" property.
How to configure Firmware Download Location in XConf?

Steps -

1. Go to the Firmware menu and select Download Location Filter.
2. Select Edit.

Refer [Xconf Server - User guide for configuration and feature validation#FeatureValidation(Firmwareupdate)](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Xconf+Server+-+User+guide+for+configuration+and+feature+validation#XconfServerUserguideforconfigurationandfeaturevalidation-FeatureValidation(Firmwareupdate)) for more details.
How to use WebPA to interact with the data model? Is this local web service running on RDK-B to manage RDK-B data model?

There should be a webpa server running somewhere (to which the device can contact). If the server is in place, you can run the commands to fetch data models from a PC that can connect to server or even from the RPi terminal itself.
What is the connection between webpa and xconf server? Any documentation is there to check?

* As such they don't have any connection between them.
* While xconf is for pushing device specific configurations to CPE, webPA is for remote device management.
* You can refer the [xconf server section in wiki](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/XConf+Server) and [WebPA](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/WebPA) for more details.

Is there any feature in xconf server to update webpa cluster url in device?

As of now we don't have a provision to update the webPA url from xconf.
How to set a parameter on the RDK device? For example, if we need to change the SSID.

This is setting a parameter using webPA

* Setting the SSID Password :

curl -X PATCH [http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config](http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config) -d '{"parameters": [ {"dataType": 0, "name": "Device.WiFi.SSID.10001.SSID", "value": "Testing"}]}' -H 'Authorization:Basic d2VicGFAMTIzNDU2Nzg5MAo='

* Getting the SSID for the board.

curl -X GET '[http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config?names=Device.WiFi.SSID.10001.SSID](http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config?names=Device.WiFi.SSID.10001.SSID)' -H 'Authorization:Basic d2VicGFAMTIzNDU2Nzg5MAo='
While
 trying to create a model using POST api request, I am getting 404
error. (xconf_Server ip i have no exposed or mentioned here and we are
using 9092 for xconf server)  GET/retrieval works fine. But again DELETE
 has the same problem.

You can delete a model using below command

* $ curl -i -X DELETE [http://xconf_server_ip:9092/delete/models/XYZ123](http://xconf_server_ip:9092/delete/models/XYZ123)

Retrieve list of models & check the particular entry is deleted:

* $ curl -i [http://xconf_server_ip:9092/queries/models](http://xconf_server_ip:9092/queries/models)

Could you tell me the command to create mac list, retrieve and delete mac list?

.ns list for mac list
Can you share the steps to setup themis as key server for authorization to scytale?

Themis was not part of the community XMidt server, we will discuss with developer and update the wiki.
What is WebPA?

* WebPA is the communication channel from Cloud to RDK based home gateway devices. It helps to manage devices from Cloud. It was built from the ground up specifically with security and performance as priorities.
* WEBPA protocol provides functionality of read/write access to device management parameters.
* The "PA" in WebPA stands for "Protocol Adapter." It's a component used to connect devices to clouds in a way that RDK licensees call "trivially scalable."

Refer [WebPA](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/WebPA) for more information.
What is basic WebPA Setup and WebPA testing process?

Refer Environment Setup in [RDK-C : WebPA Support#C:WebPASupport-EnvironmentSetup](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-C+%3A+WebPA+Support#RDKC:WebPASupport-C:WebPASupport-EnvironmentSetup)
Difference between WebPA and TR69?

TR-69 polls wide-and-deep across a device landscape, on a less frequent basis whereas WebPA can precision-poll for the most useful data, much more quickly. That's mainly because it's lightweight, and because the load can be redistributed into all the apps needing to access the data.
Can you mention few basic examples of Curl commands?

**Example 1:**Fetch device or feature parameter detail from client( RPI ) device through parodus by using webpa server.

* curl -H 'Authorization:Basic dXNlcjp3ZWJwYQo=' -i '[http://192.168.2.75:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb2e722b/config?names=Device.DeviceInfo.X_RDKCENTRAL-COM_IMAGENAME](http://34.244.61.191:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb2e722b/config?names=Device.DeviceInfo.X_RDKCENTRAL-COM_IMAGENAME)'

**Example 2:** Setting the SSID Password :

* curl -X PATCH [http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config](http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config) -d '{"parameters": [ {"dataType": 0, "name": "Device.WiFi.SSID.10001.SSID", "value": "Testing"}]}' -H 'Authorization:Basic d2VicGFAMTIzNDU2Nzg5MAo='

**Example 3:** Getting the SSID for the board.

* curl -X GET '[http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config?names=Device.WiFi.SSID.10001.SSID](http://35.155.171.121:9003/api/v2/device/mac:b827eb5681cd/config?names=Device.WiFi.SSID.10001.SSID)' -H 'Authorization:Basic d2VicGFAMTIzNDU2Nzg5MAo='

Refer WEBPA Validation Procedure Steps in [RDK-C : WebPA Support#C:WebPASupport-WEBPAValidationProcedure](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-C+%3A+WebPA+Support#RDKC:WebPASupport-C:WebPASupport-WEBPAValidationProcedure) for more information.
Is it possible to configure TFTP location for Firmware upgrade in Xconf ?

Yes ,it is possible to configure TFTP ipv4 and ipv6 locations in Xconf. Follow the steps specified here [Xconf Server - User guide for configuration and feature validation#AddTFTPlocation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Xconf+Server+-+User+guide+for+configuration+and+feature+validation#XconfServerUserguideforconfigurationandfeaturevalidation-AddTFTPlocation)
Any tools to process big data for presentation on Xconf server side?

Xconf doesn't store any data, be it logs or telemetry data. It only provides the configuration to the client device regarding where to upload the data, when to upload the data and what data it needs to be uploaded. So Xconf server doesn't need any big data processing tools.

### Xconf

***

Is there a direct interaction or dependency between the RDK cloud components Xconf and WebPA?

There is no direct interaction, both Xconf and WebPA serve different purpose. While Xconf is used by devices to fetch and configure the rules, webPA can be used to push/set the rules/attributes on a CPE device.
Does xconf upload the logs to any servers?

No, xconf doesn't directly facilitate upload logs/telemetry data. It provides devices information on where/when to upload the log files or telemetry json files.
With the new maven-frontend-plugin, do we need to install node and npm in the server?

No, the maven-frontend-plugin plugin downloads/installs Node and NPM locally for your project, runs npm install. It's supposed to work on Windows, OS X and Linux.
Is it possible to override the firmware download location set from the 'Download location filter' page?

Yes, If anyone needs to override the firmware download location, it's best to do it with a define property rule. It will only affect those devices identified in the rule.<br>
Just like tftp location is overridden like this - [Xconf Server - User guide for configuration and feature validation#AddTFTPlocation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Xconf+Server+-+User+guide+for+configuration+and+feature+validation#XconfServerUserguideforconfigurationandfeaturevalidation-AddTFTPlocation)

What is the Roadmap for the RDK?

The roadmap is always available to the Preferred and Preferred Plus members of RDK at [https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Roadmap](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Roadmap "https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/asp/roadmap") . To become a preferred member as well as to know the benefits, please visit [https://rdkcentral.com/memberships/](https://rdkcentral.com/memberships/ "https://rdkcentral.com/memberships/") . For the non preferred members, you can get answers to specific queries on Roadmap items by contacting [support@rdkcentral.com](mailto:support@rdkcentral.com) or asking at [https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/FORUMS/FORUMS+Home](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/FORUMS/FORUMS+Home) .
How to analyze the crash core dump ?

Please refer [Breakpad steps](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/Breakpad+steps)
When did the "RDK Entity" established for governance of RDK Components,features and process ?

On 15 August 2013 Comcast Cable and Time Warner Cable [jointly announced](http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/news-feed/comcast-and-time-warner-cable-form-rdk-management-llc) the formation of RDK Management, LLC to fulfill the role of the "RDK Entity".
How will backward compatibility be supported as new versions of the RDK are released?

We will maintain compatibility with the previous RDK version as described by the guidelines in the agreement. Additional details will be posted on the RDK Wiki as they become available.
What happens in the RDK if you do not want to take a whole new baseline?

Licensee are not required to take a new baseline.
What if any commercial licenses are there, are there any that require royalties?

RDKM does not assess run-time royalties for the Generic RDK.
What sort of modifications to the RDK are needed to support Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB)?

The infrastructure to support DVB exists today; but additional components may need to be developed to support the particular network type. Typical enhancements include converting a URI to a network-specific identifier in the SI handling, and enhancing the security processor to implement CA that doesn't use the cable card.
Which Closed Caption specifications are implemented in RDK?

RDK supports CEA-708 and EIA-608.
Are fonts for closed-captioning provided with RDK?

The font-type used for Closed Captioning belongs to an opensource family called Droid with specific glyphs for closed captions. Incase operators are using licensed fonts they have to meet the exclusive license requirements for those fonts.

OEM vendors will need to work with font vendors to provide fonts that comply with FCC standards. RDK Support is looking into whether FCC-compliant open-source fonts are available, and will provide that information in a future update.
What is required to support a new Video on Demand (VOD) system in RDK?

To add VOD support for a different system, the VOD client would be rewritten to talk to the appropriate backend to provide content. This is an independent implementation and not coupled to any specific MSO configuration. The client is responsible for tuning to the content, connecting it to a sink, and starting streaming. It comes into play only after a VOD request is received by the receiver, the purchase is completed, and the connection is created (_i.e.,_ broadcast has started from servers side). Because time shift buffers are not allowed for VOD content, trickplay commands are merely forwarded to the content source, which is responsible for taking the appropriate actions.
Does RDK support Audio and Video Text tags in HTML5?

Yes, RDK supports these tags in the current version.
What is the status of the RDK Device Setting API?

Device Settings is integrated with IARM, which invokes the HAL API to effect changes requested by the application. Interface specifications are available for application developers.
Are there any certified RDK-compliant DMP or DMS devices today?

The IP client provided by RDK works with the RDK Server, not the general DMS. This is the direction for now. CVP-1 and CVP-2 certification are planned for RDK Servers.
Will there be a clear separation of IP and Hybrid components?

Separate RDK release packages will be available for IP and Hybrid versions. The requirements will draw a clear distinction between IP and Hybrid components
Are there APIs to control front-panel brightness?

Control of front-panel brightness and other front-panel controls such as LED displays, power-button and similar controls will be specified as part of the Comcast Manufacturer Interface Specification.
Why
 are so many components built from external source? The recipes for
these components build from git but this is then overridden by
meta-cmf/conf/distro/include/rdk-external-src.inc which means these
components are never saved in the sstate cache making builds much longer
 than necessary. Also, many of the components compile on every rebuild
even though nothing has changed.

The answer can be "extsrc is used to faciliate easy development work. If it is preferred otherwise, there is a XXX-nosrc.xml manifest file which will be retained after the first build and hence saving time
What will be changing in the development environment?

Many developments & improvements happening in RDK .Few are listed below.

* Doxygen :Video & Broadband documentations are available in the following locations.
  - For Broadband:[https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/doxygen/rdkb/index.html](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/doxygen/rdkb/index.html)

For latest updates see Announcements at [https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/) page and "What is the Roadmap for the RDK?" question in this page to know about the Roadmap of RDK.
I
 have changes to 2 or more repos that are dependent on each other.
Â How do I force them to be submitted at the same time so the build
doesn't break?

1. git commit your changes in both the local repos
2. Create a branch and check it out in both repos make sure it has the SAME NAME (i.e. git checkout -b my_special_changes)
3. Then finally do a git review in both repos (or more specifically git review master or git review stable2)

What this does:

In gerrit the changes will be put up for review in the branch you specified in your git review command (master or stable2). At the same time it will set the Topic field to the name of your local branch (i.e. my_special_changes). When gerrit sees topic fields with identical names it binds them together. So it forces project maintainers to press the "Submit Together" button so they go in at the same time once given +2.
TDK- How to install Groovy 2.0.6 in VM (until M75)?

Install SDK if it is not already installed by following the steps under the previous heading. Install Groovy version 2.0.7 / 2.0.6 (until M75)using the below command

* `sdk install groovy 2.0.6`

Check groovy version :

* groovy -version

TDK- How to install Groovy 2.3.0 in VM? (M76 onwards)?

From M76 release onwards, the supported groovy version is groovy 2.3.0. Install SDK if it is not already installed by following the steps under the previous heading. Install Groovy version 2.3.0 using the below command â

* sdk install groovy 2.3.0

Check groovy version :

* groovy âversion

TDK- How to install MySQL?

Follow are the commands to install MySQL

* sudo apt-get install mysql-server

mysql installation will ask for the password during installation. (give the root password)

If validate_password plugin is present for Mysql, set the password policy as LOW using the below command

* set GLOBAL validate_password_policy=LOW; flush privileges";

Login to mysql prompt

* sudo mysql -u root -p

It will ask for password, give the root password given during installation.
Are there size restrictions for the firmware image?

There is no size restrictions imposed by RDK as such, the limits depends on SoC and OEM factors including Flash size . The firmware image will be compressed using SquashFS with LZMA compression.
Does
 IARM support advanced options such as marshaling, intersection,
language specific code generation?  Are there performance metrics for
IARM?

No advanced options are currently supported by the IARM. It is mainly an event bus with a pub/sub metaphor. A lot of what is available is driven by the need. If some of the features are needed we should see a feature request. We are open to discussion of improvement as long as there is a case for it. No metrics have been captured at this time outside of the overall cloud metrics where IARM is part of the overall latency.
How are redundant components (e.g., Mongoose and Lighttpd) addressed?

The various components in RDK have dependencies on other components, and some of these have similar functions. As long as the claims on memory and other system resources is small (_e.g._, Mongoose is a single file) it may be expedient to retain these redundant components.
Do we need to support/provide HDMI 2.0?

It is optional and some devices is known to have HDMI 2.0 such as accelerator.<br>

How to get plain RDK source code without soc?

Checkout relevant code repos based on your requirements from [https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/admin/repos](https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/admin/repos)

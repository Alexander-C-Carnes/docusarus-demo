	* Have a method for preventing objectionable material from being posted to your app;
	* Include a user-friendly mechanism to report offensive and/or infringing content and provide timely responses to concerns;
	* Have the ability to block abusive users from your app and/or service; and
	* Include contact information so users can easily reach you.

*If your app may not contains user-generated content or services that end up being used primarily for pornographic content, objectification of real people (e.g., “hot-or-not” voting), making physical threats, bullying, or for purposes forbidden by these Content Guidelines.*   



6. **Crypto-Currencies.** Your app may not facilitate the transaction of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin). These transactions are prohibited.

7. **Medical Content.** Medical-related content shall not contain or make false claims regarding medicine, medical treatments, and/or prescription drugs.  



8. **Misrepresentations.** Your app may not include content that contains or makes false representations about any product, service, businesses (included your own), or information, including omitting billing details, making misleading claims about weight loss or financial gain, and displaying false contact details.

In addition, X1 Apps, services and/or content that encourage or induce infringement of intellectual property rights are prohibited.

*Please note that these Content Guidelines may be amended at any time, without notice and in its sole and absolute discretion, and are in addition to any other terms, guidelines and/or standards that may apply to your app.  All interpretation and application of these Content Guidelines shall be as determined by the platform, at its sole discretion.*

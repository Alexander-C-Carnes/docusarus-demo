***THESE ADVERTISING GUIDELINES ARE NOT INTENDED AS LEGAL ADVICE.  ADHERENCE TO THESE ADVERTISING GUIDELINES IS NOT NECESSARILY SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF APPLICABLE LAWS. THE PLATFORM ENCOURAGES YOU TO CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.***

## General Responsibilities   

 
* It is your responsibility to ensure that all advertising (including the ad creative and any subsequent landing page): 
	* complies with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulations (collectively, “Laws”), guidelines regarding such assurances, including but not limited to those set forth by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and industry best practices; 
	* clearly identifies within the ad the sponsor of any advertising message; 
	* does not violate the intellectual property rights, right of publicity, right of privacy or any related rights of the platform or any third parties; 
	* claims have been substantiated before the advertisement appears; 
	* does not deceive viewers into providing personal information; 
	* does not mislead or deceive viewers into downloading software; and 
	* complies with these Advertising Guidelines, and are consistent in the information they provide (e.g., “Bait and switch” advertising is not permitted). 



## Principles Applicable to All Advertising 

### Advertising Served to Children   

* Advertising (including the serving of such advertising) shall comply with all applicable Laws and restrictions or requirements relating to serving advertising to children, including those applicable to interactive functionality and online data collection, as provided by the Children’s Television Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and/or any other applicable Law. 

* No advertising should be included within any areas of the Service that are targeted primarily to children under the age of 13.   

### Data Collection 

* Advertisements that collect personally identifiable information from users are permitted only with prior written consent from the platform. 
* Advertisements that collect information should not collect any sensitive information.  This includes information relating to certain health conditions, specific financial information, sexual preference, orientation or interests, political or union affiliation, religion, race or ethnicity. 
* Advertisements that collect information should not target children unless measures are in place (e.g., screening/obtain parental consent) as required by applicable Law. 
* Any advertisement that functions as a communication device (sends an email or IM to another user or enables SMS messaging to a cell phone or two-way pager) is deemed to be a “Data Collecting” advertisement for purposes of these Advertising Guidelines and must comply with all requirements specified here for advertising units that collect data.  In addition, “communication device” advertisements must have self-limiting controls in place to minimize potential abuse. 

### Direct Response 

* Each advertisement that provides for a direct response must include the name, street address, city, state and zip code of the sponsor or a website and/or toll-free telephone number.

* Direct response advertisements must indicate actual anticipated delivery date if anticipated delivery will be in excess of 30 days. 

### Dramatizations and Reenactments
Dramatizations and reenactments of actual events must be clearly disclosed as such.  Fictional dramatizations that are readily apparent to the user (“slice of life”) require no such disclosure.   

### Emergency Alert Signals
Advertisements that contain emergency alert signals or signals that are similar to emergency alert signals are not permitted.   

### False Claims
All advertising must tell the truth and not mislead consumers.  Known false or unwarranted claims for any product or service are prohibited under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which governs unfair or deceptive advertising in any medium. 

Foreign Language Advertisements.  Advertisements in a foreign language that is not the language primarily utilized on the Service are not permitted. 

### “Free” Claims
Any advertising that claims to offer items for “free” must comply with all state and Federal guidelines with respect to the use of the term “free” in advertising and disclose all material terms and conditions for obtaining the free item (e.g., advertising may not suggest that an item is “free” when receiving the item is in fact conditioned upon signing up for or purchasing the advertiser’s good or service, unless that fact is properly disclosed).

### Profanity   

* Advertising may not contain profanity, other than use of the words “hell” or “damn”.  If such words are used in an advertisement, such advertisements may not be (1) placed or served on any area that primarily contains family- oriented or children’s content or (2) in the case of video advertising, included in any family or children’s video content.

### Visuals and Supers

# Application Rating Guidelines
When you fill out the app creation form in the developer portal, you are required to choose a content rating for your app, which may change over time.â€¯The purpose of the rating is to provide users with a simple way to determine if your app contains content they might find objectionable.

These ratings are used to control when PIN protections are presented. See [Parental Controls](./parental-controls.md) for more information.

## Your app rating
| Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| App Rating | The rating of your app must be equivalent to the highest rated content on your app. For example, if your app contains any content which falls into a higher age rating (even if it is not the majority of content), your app rating must be the higher rating.
| Content Guidelines | Your app must follow our [Content and Service Guidelines](./content-service-guidelines.md).
| Unrated Content | If your app contains any unrated content, your app must be rated **Adults**.
| User-Generated Content | If your app contains any user-generated content, your app must be rated **Adults**.
